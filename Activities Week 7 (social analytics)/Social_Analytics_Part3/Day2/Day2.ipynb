    "# Students Turn Activity 7 Frequent Twitter Miles\n",
    "\n",
    "Airlines get a lot of flack on twitter, especially from big time Journalists who think they are the only ones affected by flying. Lets see what kind of tone everyone else takes when tweeting about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your goal is to retrieve 1000 tweets for each of the 7 popular airlines and run a VADER sentiment analysis on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create an empty list to hold to results from each airline,\n",
    "\n",
    "* Filter the tweets using the given \"Real Person\" filter variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a \"sentiment\" dictionary for each airline that includes the search term, and the averages of the compound, neutral, positive, and negative scores.  Print this dictionary and append it to a list holding each airline's results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a DataFrame to display the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HINTS\n",
    "\n",
    "* Start with a subset of data for each airline while testing. Then, adapt your code to collect all 1000 tweets per airline.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For a reference on using max_id, see this link: [Working with Timelines](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/timelines/guides/working-with-timelines)\n",
