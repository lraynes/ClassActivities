    "* Create an empty list to hold to results from each airline,\n",

    "\n",
    "* Create a \"sentiment\" dictionary for each airline that includes the search term, and the averages of the compound, neutral, positive, and negative scores.  Print this dictionary and append it to a list holding each airline's results.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a DataFrame to display the results.\n",
