    "# Activity 3 Instructor Do: Introduction to Queries \n",
    "\n",
    "* So far, the class has only learned how to perform basic queries to search through data tables. There are plenty of ways in which to perform more complex searches though.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recall that, in order to select all of the data from a table, the code `SELECT * FROM <Tablename>` is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * In order to select specific rows from a table based upon some values stored within a column, a `WHERE <column> = <value>` statement is added into the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For example, to select only those rows within the \"birdsongs\" table whose \"genus\" is \"Acanthis\", `SELECT * FROM birdsong WHERE genus = \"Acanthis\"` would be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Select Where](Images/03-Queries_Where.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * There may be cases in which users desire to search for rows where two conditions or more are met. MySQL allows this by using the `AND` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For example, to select rows within the \"birdsongs\" table whose \"genus\" is \"Acanthis\" and whose \"country\" is \"Netherlands, `SELECT * FROM birdsong WHERE genus = \"Acanthis\" AND country =\"Netherlands\"` would be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Where And](Images/03-Queries_WhereAnd.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `OR` statements can also be used when creating queries to search for rows whose values match in one way or another. For example to select rows where the \"genus\" can be \"Acanthis\" or \"Acrocephalus\", `SELECT * FROM birdsong WHERE genus = \"Acanthis\" OR genus = \"Acrocephalus\"` would be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Finally it is also possible to search for results by excluding certain criteria by using the `WHERE NOT` statement. For example to find all row where \"\" is not the genus use `SELECT * FROM birdsong WHERE NOT genus = \"Anthus\";`"
