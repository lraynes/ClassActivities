250635,Comcast Cable Internet Speeds,4/22/2015,3:53:50 PM,Internet,Abingdon,Maryland,21009,Closed,No,"I have been contacting Comcast Internet Technical Support for the last 12 months to resolve slow Internet Speed issues with no permanent resolution. They have also sent Techs to my residence and replaced Hardware.
 I pay an additional monthly fee for these services and have not received them. When I speak to management they are very arrogant and rude. Their tone is demeaning and unapologetic. A resolution to my problem is never reached. Most of the time I get hung up on or experience long hold times.
 My complaint is that I have been paying for services that I am not receiving. I pay for High Speed Internet, Boost Internet Speeds, Reliable Service and Acceptable Technical Support and I do not receive any of the above. I feel like I have been duped into paying for these services without actually receiving them. I can accurately say that for the last 12 months I have paid $60 a month for High Speed Internet and have not received anything remotely close to High Speed Internet. Every time I have contacted Comcast I have made it extremely clear that I am not receiving the services I am paying for and Comcast continues to bill me for the services I am not receiving.

223441,Payment disappear - service got disconnected,4/8/2015,10:22:56 AM,Internet,Acworth,Georgia,30102,Closed,No,"Back in January 2015 I made 2 payments: One for January's service and one for February's service (advance payment). In March I go to the web page to make my payment and I see that my account shows past due. I call Comcast to find out where my payment went since it was deducted from my bank account. I offered them to send a copy of my bank statement. They did not seem to care about that. They give me a confirmation number for the investigation and they promise to call me back. Not only they did not call me back but they turned off my service. I called again and they gave me another confirmation number of the same investigation. They promised to restore my service while the investigation is completed. My service is still off. I had to call me bank and start another investigation. Comcast does not seem to care at all. Are they committing FRAUD with their customer's money?

242732,Speed and Service,4/18/2015,9:55:47 AM,Internet,Acworth,Georgia,30101,Closed,Yes,"Our home is located at in Acworth Georgia 30101. We signed a one year contract with Comcast / Xfinity for high speed internet service starting on July 2014. The account number is . The base rate is $39.99 billed monthly. I am sending this compliant on behalf of my partner/husband Mr. . whoâ€™s name is on the contact.
 The service agreement was for high speed internet only at the speed of 50Mbps. On average the internet speed is half of the promised agreement at our location. The service for the past month has become much slower in the ranges of 5 to 15Mbps. We placed a service call on 04/018/2015 and was given 4 appointment times after repeated calls. Each appointment was missed and no one showed up to investigate the problem. While on the phone with each CSR (customer service rep) they would review the inbound service line remotely to â€œclearâ€ the line. This has been done several times prior to this date over the past year. Our service will go out and drop for several hours at a time, especially on Sunday evenings. I contacted the CSR again around 7PM EST on 04/01/2015 to complain about the lack of service and to get a confirmed service appointment. Finally after being on the phone for 30 minutes and the CSR was very helpful. He cleared the line and the speed came up to around 25Mbps but not to a full speed as the contract has promised. A tech come out on Thursday 04/02/2015 and replaced couplers inside and outside that were not properly installed. The technician stated â€œthe hardware in the outside boxes needed repair and updated.â€ The outside units that provide service to our home are outdated and never was updated. He stated this is the reason we are only getting less than half of the speed in our home. He placed a service request for someone to come out on Friday 04/03/2015. No one has showed up and no one has followed up with us regarding this issue.
 Today is 04/18/2015 and our internet speed is only at 17Mbps download and 11.99Mbps upload. I have attached a screen print of the speed test via their website. I am asking that every service line and box be updated and repaired in our neighborhood. Also since Comcast / Xfinity has failed to provide the contracted service for almost 10 months. We are asking for a full refund of our service agreement and demand 1 full year of service at no cost. This lack of service must stop or we will seek additional legal advice and resources.

277946,Comcast Imposed a New Usage Cap of 300GB that punishes streaming.,5/7/2015,11:59:35 AM,Internet,Acworth,Georgia,30101,Open,Yes,"Comcast in the Atlanta area has just put into effect an unprecendented usage cap of 300GB. If you
 exceed this cap, you are charged an extra $10 per 50GB. If you stream from online services in
 standard HD, you can hit this cap extremely easily. Comcast has never capped usage before this
 year and before the new net neutrality rules went into effect. I feel their practices are unfair as there is
 no competition in the Atlanta market. They can treat their customers however they choose and it's not
 right."
307175,Comcast not working and no service to boot,5/26/2015,1:25:26 PM,Internet,Acworth,Georgia,30101,Solved,No,"I have been a customer of Comcast of some sort for 20 years now and have never had issues like I
 am having now and the past 4 years.
 For the past 4 years I have had issue with my internet service with them. And every time I call I seem
 to get the run around. Their customer no service apparently has no way to contact their techs that
 come out on site. Any way to the problem at hand. My connection goes up and down constantly over
 and over again and has been for nearly 4 years at least and the past year it has gotten worse. The
 odd thing is that prior to a few months ago when it went down was between the hours of 10 am and 6
 pm eastern Monday thru Friday. The weekends it seemed to be fine no issues but I work from home
 a great deal and I need my connection up and running Monday thru Friday and being an on call Tech
 Support person myself I need this up and running at all times. Every time I call it seems to be the
 same story over and over again power cycle your modem which of course this has already been
 done. I have been told to go swap out my modem I believe at least 5 times the past year. I do and
 same issues. They send a tech out and I get told its my splitters that they provided so they re do
 them and what not and of course my connection works for a few days or even weeks but then issues
 start up once again. This time however my connection drops totally and has been down 3 days now.
 I called Sunday evening when it first went down and was informed someone would be out within the
 day, whatever that means so I had to clarify within 24 hours. I was given a ticket number this time
 which I usually don't get. I was told at 12:33 pm the next day I would get a call from the technician
 coming out or their department. The person specifically stated 12:33 pm I would get a call. So did I
 no I didn't I waited another 20 minutes then called and referenced my ticket number and was told it
 was closed. So of course this made me furious the tech opened a new ticket then again was told
 someone would be out within the day. I informed them that wasn't good enough. Then I was given a
 time of 3 to 5 pm the same day someone would be out. Of course this did not happen either. So I
 called again around 4 pm and told my story once again. This time I requested to speak to a
 supervisor and was informed no one was available. Then after being hung up on several times while
 waiting on a supervisor I was finally told that they were all in a meeting and one will call me back. Of
 course this never happened either. Knowing that I needed my connection back up they set me an
 appointment up for the following Thursday I informed them that wouldn't work then they gave me a
 time of 8 am to 8 pm someone would be out. So now once again I will have to waste my whole day
 waiting on someone and I have a strong feeling they will not show as it is now 1:20 pm and have still
 not received a call back.
 My wife and I are moving in a month have are now going with their competition in that area. The
 competition if they were able to come to my current area informed me they would be pleased to come
 out this afternoon and install everything. But unfortunately they are no longer adding more DSL
 customers in my area as their other option is still rolling out with new infrastructure at this time."
338519,ISP Charging for arbitrary data limits with overage fees,6/12/2015,9:59:40 PM,Internet,Acworth,Georgia,30101,Solved,No,"To whom it may concern:
 I am a Comcast customer in the metro Atlanta area. This area is a test area for overage charges for using too much data with Comcast. This past month I was informed that I had reached this arbitrary limit on my data usage of 300 GB per month. They told me I could use more data, but it would cost $10.00 per 50 GB of data.
 I believe that this is unjust as we are using our internet connection for streaming TV shows and movies because we do not subscribe to cable. Comcast is in essence punishing us for not having a pay TV subscription with them.
 There was no limit before and now they are trying to slowly impose one and we are sadly the first pawns in the chess set to be taken down by Comcast's arbitrary data limits and per GB fees.

361148,Throttling service and unreasonable data caps,6/24/2015,10:13:55 AM,Internet,Acworth,Georgia,30101,Pending,No,"Good morning,
 Comcast has been throttling my internet speed for years. I understand that the offer is for up to 50 gigabits but there have been times where 1 device connected to the modem would speedtest ookla (which comcast has fast tracked) to .0125 gigabits per second.
 When I called comcast on the issue they said ""I have taken away the bad internet. Good bye."" and hung up on me this has happened to me multiple times during WWE PPVs through the WWE network. It was unwatchable. I missed special events because comcast, I believe, would rather have me purchase it through them.
 More recently, I have been having issues when online gaming. I have a router that tracks modem speeds and it seems to drop to 5-10 megabits per second during peek hours (after dinner and before bed).
 Whenever I hear a radio ad where they brag about their speeds being 10 times faster than dial-up I laugh.
 I feel like I'm being punished for having a 5-star Comcast approved modem and not renting one of their modems or switching to business class. Or maybe it's because we cut the cable television.
 Speaking of throttling, I suppose the best part is I can never get full quality netflix. Now, this sounds bad but with the unreasonable data cap of 300 gigabytes if I received my full speed I would have 66.66666 (repeating of course) hours a month to use it.
 My family is reliant on the internet. After work I sometimes stream games with my buddy. My wife watches Netflix in her free time. My son LOVES Youtube minecraft videos and has his friends over to watch videos. If we got full speeds on Netflix, we'd be in trouble.
 If I were to buy a new AAA PC game on steam, I would use 1/6th of my data cap to download something I have just paid $60 dollar on.
 In short, the ""test market"" of implemented data caps is a cash grab. I would expect if that were to be implemented the cost of going from unlimited to 300 megabytes would be lowered. There was no price drop.

359792,Comcast refuses to help troubleshoot and correct my service.,6/23/2015,6:56:14 PM,Internet,Adrian,Michigan,49221,Solved,No,"When I moved to Michigan I contacted Comcast regarding internet service and was told several times that the internet package I was interested in would be perfect for my gaming needs. I specifically asked about port forwarding and hosting small gaming servers on my laptop. They assured me that this was possible with their service at my location.
 I have never been able to do this. I have contact customer services 3 times. Each instance of seeking help lasted for several days before I was worn down by them and gave up. Each instance spanned dozens of phone calls and hours of web chat.
 Port forwarding consists of allowing outside computers to access your computer directly. This is absolutely vital if you with to play with friends.
 Hosting of servers does not involve an actual specialized server computer, but instead a small instance of a specialized program published by the game's developer. This is a very common practice and is vital for playing many games.
 I have never had a problem running these programs until I moved to this location. I have tried everything. New routers, different computers, etc.
 I have contacted Comcast about this seeking help many times. Each time they run through their script, and after at least an hour escalate me to more proficient tech support. At this level they tell me I need new equipment, that it should be working, or, more frequently, that if I would only upgrade my service, I would be able to successfully port forward and have friends connect to my computer. Over and over I have spent hours with them, only to be told that for more money each month the service I was promised from the get-go would be available.
 I believe that I was lied to when I was assured that I could port forward from this location, and if I had been told the truth, I would not have signed a contract with them.

318072,Comcast extended outages,6/1/2015,11:46:30 PM,Internet,Alameda,California,94502,Closed,No,"Comcast Xfinity cable service was interrupted May 30 at 9:09 PM PT for over 20 minutes and hold times for Comcast customer service was over 10 minutes. Again today cable service is interrupted at 8:30 PM PT and customers service hold times by Comcast's stated automated estimate is over 1 hour 30 minutes and Comcast's stated estimate is that service is not expected to be restored until 11:16 PM PT - 2:44 minutes later -- the full extent of my evening free time. Additionally internet service is degraded as well (by Comcast's own report).
 I do not pay Comcast for service for when it is convenient for them to deliver service, but for when I want it and need to use it which is primarily in the evening. This is unacceptable and assuming I ever get to speak to a Comcast representative (I am currently still on hold), I will be asking for a partial refund for failure to deliver contracted services.

Specifically, when entering my information into the tablet at the front of the store, it asked if i was there to disconnect services. I selected 'yes'. Then when dealing with the customer service rep, I told her I was returning my equipment to disconnect my account. I also asked her about my final bill, and she told me it would be sent through the normal billing. A few weeks later I got a call that the account was past due, and have been dealing with them not disconnecting the account as asked since.

238694,Comcast owes me $65 and claims I need to return equipment I never had,4/16/2015,10:04:57 AM,Internet,Alexandria,Virginia,22304,Closed,No,"Four months ago, I moved to a new apartment within the same building. At the time that I moved, I had a credit on my account with Comcast for about $65 (because I was up-to-date on my payments and moved out partway through a billing cycle). Comcast has NEVER applied the credit to my new account or sent me a check even though I have spoken when at least ten agents regarding this issue (and have been promised every time that I would be credited the amount I am owed). To matters worse, I recently began getting automated phone calls from a third party working on behalf of Comcast stating that I never returned the equipment from my old apartment. I NEVER had any equipment from them; I own my own modem. The third-party company has no option to speak to a live agent so I have no way of telling them that there was no equipment in the first place. I have contacted Comcast at least 10 times regarding these issues but the calls have not stopped. I am still owed the $65 and I am still getting harassed with daily phone calls about returning equipment I never had in the first place. I will sue Comcast if this goes on for much longer.

318725,Failure to provide services that I am billed for.,6/2/2015,1:03:52 PM,Internet,Alexandria,Virginia,22314,Closed,No,"Comcast is currently charging me for a service called the Blast PLUS plan, where I am to receive a download rate of 100 MB per second. Not once since receiving the service has my internet gotten anywhere near that. The most I can get is 70 MB per second, unfortunately this happens only once or twice per month or is an unusual spike in that last for a minute. The reality and average speed is about 50 MB per second, which is at least half of what I am being billed for. This also does not take into account the biweekly issues we have of signal drops, which when called to fix they state that its a signal node issue and that no one else has complained about or that the weather has affected my signal (currently I reside in the Washington DC metro area).

My bill is nearly $250/ month and my internet fails every 4th day... They will not comp the service for more than a day here or there because they have no concern about the amount of lost productivity I experience due to the lack of Internet not do they care about the amount of time that my wife and I spend waiting for them to show up with a different tech who also can not find s permanent solution.
 This abject lack of concern for the client or the quality of service is made possible by YOU allowing them to be a virtual monopoly in our town. I would be far more upset with Comcast out it weren't for the fact that they have been empowered by or government WHO IS SUPOSED TO BE WATCHING OUT FOR THE CITIZENS!!!

328742,horrible cable service and customer service,6/8/2015,3:18:58 PM,Internet,Alexandria,Virginia,22312,Solved,No,"I would like to file a complaint on comcast also known as Xfinity. I have had service with them since December 2014. Due to my building needing wires repaired, my service never worked or worked once a week only for a few hours. I was able to use the Internet sometimes. I've made several attempts to have a tech come out to service my cable/internet/phone. Which they either never showed up or canceled my appointment without my acknowledgement and later say they will give me a credit for that. I've reached out to managers and area directors via email still no actions or a email response back.
 Finally after complaining every other day or week ""5 months later"" I was able to get a tech/techs to come out and replace all wiring in the building since my whole building was out of service and they told us all we are still responsible for our bill. My complaint is. .. I was told on April 24th 2015 that I would receive a credit on my account for a total of $494.63 for all of the months I was out of cable. That is still not the full amount of cable which I pay for each month. My account is always past due because I was told once I pay it in full the credit will be posted to my account and that has yet to happen. I called today June 7 2015 on behalf of the credit so I could pay the remainder which would be $50-ish and spoke with a agent by the name of Jason, his attitude alone was my breaking point. He told me he will not transfer me to a manager because they will tell me the same thing and my credit was denied because i was still able to use my some time-ish internet.
 Please something has to be done. This company knows they have no other competition and feels they could treat their customers any kind of way especially if they are in a contract, such as myself. Any suggestions? I'm not the only consumer complaining about this company. I bet if your company fined them $1000 each complaint the service would be so much better. Please help us. ... end the contracts to sh#@y service.

328165,Speed,6/8/2015,12:03:37 PM,Internet,Alexandria,Virginia,22304,Solved,No,"I have technicians coming over and the problem was never fixed. My internet connection keeps disconnecting, the streaming is bad, my speed it supposed to be around 105mbps and its is never close to that. I am tired of calling them and they try to fix everything online and is not working. They keep saying that if they send a technician it will be $40 dollars. I used to have my own modem and recently changed to their modem because supposedly my brand new modem was bad. Prices are abusive for a really low quality service. Costumer service is horrible. My current bill is around 115 and is going to go up to 125 next year according to their new contract method which is not even clear. If you try to disconnect their system now they charge you like $10 dollars for the months left on the contract and they never explain that in any of the calls. If you call for cancellation they are always hanging up the phone and trying to get you involve into a contract. It is the only company that supports high speed internet in my area and they are taking advantage of that. I am paying for a service that should be monitor since is not giving the customers what they are paying for. You spend around 2-3 hours trying to fix a problem with them which I think is not very efficient. You can look at the reviews online how many people is been affected by this company services.

370363,COMCAST!,6/27/2015,6:37:29 PM,Internet,Alexandria,Virginia,22305,Solved,No,"My boyfriend has complained already about this issue, but I'm going to add mine as well. I may not ""officially"" be the consumer since my name is not on the bill, but I am the one that actually needs the internet for school, so I consider myself an official consumer of this product. To reiterate my boyfriend's initial complaint: We are paying for 25 mbps for our internet speed and are only receiving on AVERAGE 4-8 mbps, sometimes it dips as low as 0.02. Yes. ZERO. POINT. TWO. This has been going on FOR MONTHS. This is unacceptable. If that weren't enough, Comcast has admitted on several occasions that it is on their end and/or their equipment is causing the issue. We were afraid to have a tech come out to us, as they are deceptive about charging hundreds of dollars for a tech to come out, even though they say they won't (you can google this, there are numerous complaints about that issue itself). We finally agreed to have a tech come out because it is better than sitting here with useless internet access.
 On to my complaint: The first appointment we tried to schedule was for a 6:30-8:30pm time slot. We wait around and then we get a call from them saying they're not sure why the appointment was made for that time because they don't even schedule them that late! What? How does this even happen?!
 The second appointment was scheduled for today from 3:00-5:00pm. It is 5:50pm and surprise, surprise, THEY DIDN'T SHOW UP! I finally have a Saturday off- one that I would much rather spend doing something fun for once, but no, I have to waste a perfectly good day off waiting around for no one! I donâ€™t even get a call, NOTHING!
 As you can see, I am very very frustrated with this company. They have a monopoly, and thus they hold the internet hostage. They donâ€™t care about the consumer, but they demand hundreds of dollars a month and for what? 0.02 mbps speed internet. They are nothing but a bunch of crooks. Itâ€™s PATHETIC that they are allowed to do this and have been doing it for YEARS.
 I need the internet to study for my board exam I have to take in less than a month. I work full time, sometimes putting in 60+ hours/wk. I do not have time to deal with such ineptitude, I am stressed enough as it is. I just moved into my boyfriend's place, so I cannot go to the library because I don't have mail here yet. I cannot study in a crowded noisy coffee shop- I would like to be able to study and have use of the internet in my own home, ESPECIALLY if I/we are paying for 25 mbps! We work hard for our money, we would like to make good use of it. I know we are not the only ones and I think it's deplorable that Comcast is allowed to steal millions of people's money for NOTHING.

 So we can address your complaint as quickly as possible, please provide the information described below within 7 business days.

 month and Economy Plus internet service (3 Mbps) for $19.99 per month. I was able to add both
 these services to the cart and check out. However, the xfinity representative called a couple of days
 later and said that I could not have the services selected even though either one was available in my
 area. Instead they said I would have to select either their Internet Plus package (10 channels and 25
 Mbps Internet) for 39.99/mo or their Blast Plus (45 channels and 50 Mbps) for 59.99/mo. When
 escalated to a manager they indicated that it was because I was selecting both a TV and Internet
 offer. There was no disclosure on teh website that both offers are not available together and it seems
 outragous that I can not take advantage of both deals."
355976,Comcast Customer Service,6/22/2015,2:10:39 PM,Internet,Aliquippa,Pennsylvania,15001,Open,No,"We are trying to get an itemization of our Bill from Comcast / Xfinity. My husband is a disabled veteran and is going back to school so that he might be able to have a Career that will sustain for the rest of his years until he is at retirement age. Because of the help from the VA department he can be reimbursed for the portion of the bill that we pay for the internet. We have been trying to get an itemization so that we can submit it for reimbursement. Little did we know that this would end up being one of the hardest things to do? I have called last month and try to get the answer in writing. The Customer Service department told me that they could not do that, they told me that they could tell me verbally and I could write it down. That is not how it works in the system. We have to show the VA that this is who we have service through and the amount that we are paying.
 I called again yesterday June 18,2015 and asked again for the information that I needed, I was told then that they could unbundle our bill and once we saw the information that we needed we could bundle our bill again, but that they could not guarantee that it would be the same price that we are paying right now. I asked to talk to a Supervisor who in turn told me the same thing. He told me that he can go to the information in our plan and click the plus button next to the plan we are on and that shows him the price of the internet and the modem. He stated that he could not e-mail me the information because of the chance of him or Comcast being held accountable. I then told him that I wanted to speak to someone higher up than him. He asked me who I thought that might be. I told him that he had to have a Boss and I wanted to speak to that person. He told me that they were off. Find it hard to believe. I then told him that there had to be a Number or a Place that I could talk to someone with higher authority than he has. He finally gave me a number to call and address to write to.
 I called the number and got a hold of someone in the Executive Customer Care department, who were helpful to a small extent. They escalated the issue to a higher position. I asked that they call me on my cell phone because I had things that I had to do. They did call but on our house phone, I did not get the message until after 6:30 with a case number to reference. The message stated that you could call between the hours of 8 AM to 7PM Monday thru Friday. I immediately tried to call and was directed to an answering machine; I left my information and have not had a return phone call. I gave them till 10:26 this morning and tried again and got the same voice mail message. I waited until 10:58 and called the number for the Executive Customer Care team again. I then explained again what was going on and advised that I again needed a call back to be on my cell phone. I still have yet to get a call back, so I tried again at 3:43 and got the same message, I called the Executive Customer Care Team at 3:45 PM. I told the woman that I spoke to that If I did not get a call back by 6:00PM I was contacting the Attorney General , The PUC, The FCC and whatever other agency that I needed to.
 It is now after 6:00PM on June 19, 2015. I am sending a copy of this letter to Comcast and all of the above mentioned agencies. We feel that we are not asking for anything that is not ours. This should have been as simple as where would you like this to be sent to.

 the local office. which I did next day morning. But still it was not able to detect the modem. Then I

 help they try to sell phone service. I got mad because of all these and hung up.
 Now I see an confirmation email and they are going to charge me $193 (estimated total) due to this
 move.
 It is really frustrating the way they are looting their customers after so many hassle. I loss office hours

 the phone that they will not charge anything.

 internet has been disconnected and in order to reconnected it I have to pay $30.40 and they are
 requesting for my credit or debit card information in addition they are requesting to make a direct
 withdraw from my bank account. The message in my computer is requesting to access to a website:
 https://consumer.comcast.com/walledgarden
 I have immediately called Comcast and they knew about this situation and apologized to me and said
 that they will fix the problem but hasnâ€™t fixed the problems yet. I cannot access to my computer and
 have been trying to call Comcast since then and cannot go through. I also want to indicate that my
 monthly bill with Comcast has increased for equipment (modem) that I bought on my own at this
 point I think they are charging me for a modem that they donâ€™t even supply me. Another issue is that
 Comcast does not advertise the price for services online. I have to call Comcast to get that info.
 RESOL: I want to have my internet connection connected back, I donâ€™t think I have to pay for
 equipment that they do not supply to me and I want to see the prices for services online. CTR-11"
348923,Comcast blocking DirecTv signals,6/18/2015,1:50:02 PM,Internet,Ambridge,Pennsylvania,15003,Open,No,"Comcast is provably throttling the signal of customers who use alternative TV service. We switched to Dish Network a few years ago, anytime we tried to use on Demand it said our signal was too slow. Then we switched to DirectTv. The same thing happened until I swit our router to Open DNS. Now Comcast has moved everyone to their new gateway midem/routers and once again it is impossible to use On Demand satellite services. This is the same thing did with NetFlix before they reached a settlement. My parents also switched to an alternative TV provider and immediately their internet slowed to the point of being useless too and they can not use on Demand features either. Just Google this complaint and you will see that anyone who rejects Comcast TV service pays for it with inferior Internet speeds and almost no access to satellite providers. For further proof, other streaming services and NetFlix ( post settlement) work fine.

236469,Deceptive sales- change in billing amount etc.,4/15/2015,10:16:14 AM,Internet,Ann Arbor,Michigan,48104,Closed,No,"I ordered an internet plan. I was told it would be $49.99 but was billed $54.99. They said the 'extra' $5 was for not having ""Ecobilling"" yet i was never told that I needed this when I agreed to the plan & price.
 Furthermore, in the meantime. I've asked for a plan with a lower rate i can afford- just with internet- but they consistently come back with bundled plans that include TV etc. They have the only really acceptable product for inteernt service in my area.
 My request now is to be billed as I was sold- at $49.99/mo- already $5 over my previous plan & not $10as they've done. ( Though, i did try to get onto Ecobill- with no luck - & over an hour dealing with their reps,etc. & at this point I'd rather not)
 I feel their sales techniques & representation of the service & fee was deceptive. Their company was built on public trust- the laying of cable lines etc.- yet they go to great lengths to take advantage & squeeze out excessive rates. ( Also, $10/ month for modem rental? You've got to be kidding! I finally figured that out on my own & bought one)

288602,Comcast Billing Dispute,5/13/2015,6:20:32 PM,Internet,Ann Arbor,Michigan,48105,Closed,No,"Comcast refuses to let me cancel my internet/cable and provide proof that my service has been
 terminated. I have called 4 times (and counting hangups/discontents pushing 15 calls) and requested
 2 emails.
 I called on May the 4th 2015 to get my Comcast internet/cable canceled as I will no longer be living at
 my current residence. I will be moving for work. I do not have any of Comcast's equipment thus a
 cancellation of service should be relatively easy. When I first talked to the representative Kate, she
 attempted to make me feel bad for canceling both internet and cable. Then she told me that they
 have a system upgrade going on and they can not process my request until an hour later. Her
 supervisor (Jake employee ID:6850SR) reiterated her story about the system upgrade. Kate called
 me back to tell me that the upgrade will take until their office closes and that they will call me back the
 next day to complete the request. They never called. This is how Comcast found a way to extend the
 billing date. I was told the ending date was on May the 4th but when I called on the 5th they claimed it
 was the 5th.
 I have spoken with many representatives. Two of which have said ""I will get an email at
 confirming the cancellation within 24 hours""(both read the email address to me
 letter by letter). The last of these representatives being Tamika (?) (Employee ID 1361) from the
 retention department. I have received no such email (not even in my spam folder).
 As of May 13th Comcast's telephone tree disconnects me right before talking to an agent. I am
 contacting the FCC in the hopes that they can help resolve this dispute. Furthermore, I hope this
 indicates what poor customer service Comcast continues to have despite their claims to try to get
 better. Thank you fro your attention to this matter.

309379,Comcast,5/27/2015,1:50:37 PM,Internet,Ann Arbor,Michigan,48105,Solved,No,"Hello,
 I signed up for Comcast internet on 01/30/15 and received the equipment on 02/04. I plugged in the
 equipment on 02/06 yet there's no signal. I called the Comcast and they could not get a signal from
 their end either. The representative told me that she needed to send someone out to take a look. I
 asked if there's going to be a charge, she said no (and I assume this was recorded), said since I was
 a new customer and they were not able to activate my account/modem, there shouldn't be any
 charge.
 The technician came out and fixed the problem on 02/09 . All he did was to connect the cable at the
 switch box located somewhere in our subdivision. The technician specifically told me the cable for
 my house was never connected and the line was not properly labeled either. After he connected the
 cable line, I was able to get a signal.
 I was subsequently charged $39.95 for this ""Technician Visit"" that occurred on 02/09. I do not agree
 that I should be paying for this charge for the following reasons:
 1. The contract I signed specifically said there's no activation fee. As a new customer, whatever
 Comcast needed to do in order to activate my new account/modem, should not be my responsibility.
 The sole purpose of the ""Technician Visit"" was to connect the cable at the switch box that Comcast
 owns; this is the very basic, necessary step that Comcast must perform in order to provide me the
 internet connection that I have signed up for. If Comcast requires a new customer to pay for their
 cable to be connected at the switch box, it should have been disclosed up front - in my case, it wasn't.
 2. I have contacted Comcast Customer Service 6 times to resolve this ""Technician Visit"" charge. The
 first three times I was assured a credit of equal will be issued within 24-48 hours (and I assume these
 phone calls were recorded) but it never happened. Then I was told nothing was documented in the
 work log. Then I was told it has to be escalated and it'll take another 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I
 was getting fined for late payment (of this disputed charge) and that my service will be cancelled if I
 do not pay this charge. The last time I contacted Comcast, I was told there's nothing they can do. So
 I had no choice but paid the $39.95.
 I wanted to bring this to your attention because I am so appalled by the way Comcast conducts their
 business. I believed I have been unfairly charged for the technician visit fee, and the representatives
 at Customer Service are not held accountable for what's been said or promised.
 Thanks,"

He started a bundle in September and in December he started being charged a $10 for equipment. They never notified him of the increase. This started other billing issues, Comcast requesting an extra $100 almost every month. He returned the equipment that he was being charged $10 extra for but Comcast still bills him. Comcast also frequently shuts his internet service off, two to three times per month for illegitimate reasons. He will call Comcast and they say they have to change his frequency. He does not have very many neighbors and during the outages most people are at work, so it cannot be a congestion issue. They do this but still charge the same price. Today the internet service went out again and Comcast said to replace the equipment when the service worked fine yesterday and was working for three weeks. They have no regards for their customers. He feels like he is being opposed and taken advantage of by Comcast. Comcast sucked over $400 in extra fees from him since starting services. Comcast says these charges are legitimate and refuse to budge. As a resolution, he would like Comcast to refund him for the additional fees that they did not notify him about. He would also like a refund for the time that his internet service was out and for them to resolve the issue that causes the internet to go out. ***CTR359-phone***

She was under the assumption she was still on the internet essentials program but when she went to pay her bill at the store she talked to the employee and they said she was not on the program any longer and she was paying for the home phone. She found out her services were shut off last Friday and are still currently off. When she called Comcast on this and asked why her services were off they were not sure so they turned it back on. She was supposed to have to the 16th to pay the past due but she shouldnâ€™t pay the bill until a supervisor called back and straightened out the bill with her but no one called her. Once she talked with Comcast they informed her that they could credit her one month of service and give 6 months of a premium channel even though she overpaid 16 months of service. Comcast said she should have caught the issue within 6 months of getting the service which she did in February however that rep said he fixed the issue and gave her the free home phone. As a resolution she feels the company owes her more than what she received for the inconvenience this has caused her. She said that they should have offered like 6 months free service or at least give her some of her money back that she over paid. She also has another call back number of . ***CTR 354-phone***

My bill has been increasing substantially, but I cannot reach customer service in a reasonable fashion to get an explanation as to why. I've tried to call or contact customer service online three times over the course of the past several months to get my issue resolved, and have been on hold for almost an hour. Once I hung up, another time I finally got a customer service rep after over an hour. When I asked her why my bill increased so much even though I haven't changed service, she said it's because it's a new account and they include the set up fee. What??? I've had this account for almost 9 years. Was on with her for another 15 or 20 minutes and then just could not waste more time on it. Their website says they have customer service agents available 24/7 by phone. When you call the phone in the evening (as many working/commuting people must have to do), it tells you they only answer phones from 7 to 7, but that if you go online, there's someone available 24/7. And when you go online, there is no (easily identifiable) link to speak with customer service. In the meantime, I have yet another increase, so now it seems to me that I'm paying almost $20 more per month than I was when I opened the account, but with no extra service. I went to their Facebook page and see complaint after complaint about their service, but it is still subpar. Unfortunately they have basically a monopoly in this area, unless I go with satellite cable, which I am at the point of doing. I don't know how they can make it so difficult for customers to get their issues resolved.

227209,Comcast credit after cancellation has not been received after more than a year,4/9/2015,4:40:05 PM,Internet,Arlington,Virginia,22202,Closed,No,"As can be seen from my final statement from Comcast (attached), I canceled internet service on March 23, 2014 for service at , 22202. I subsequently moved to Apt. in the same apartment complex, which Comcast was aware of and is the address listed on the final statement.
 The statement said I was due a $54.77 payment credit.
 After many months, I still had not been paid the $54.77 payment credit I was owed. I called Comcast, and was told for some reason they believed I had un-returned equipment (a cable modem) that had caused the payment credit to be withheld, pending some investigation.
 I have owned my cable modem for years, and bought it from a friend when I lived in Seattle years ago (the service at issue here is in Virginia). One of the reasons why I canceled Comcast, in fact, was because they started charging me, spontaneously after having service for many many months, a modem rental charge for my own modem that I had been using the entire time. I had to call Comcast to have the monthly charge removed (which they did). You can see no mention of a modem rental charge as a service that I canceled on page two of the attached statement.
 It has now been over one year since I have been owed my $54.77 credit. I would like to be payed what I am owed, and am very displeased with Comcast's insistence completely out of the blue that my modem spontaneously became theirs.

I was surprised to see $100 dollar monthly bill that includes charges for the basic cable box self install kit and $59.99 for plan charges. I called 3 times and explain my initial conversation with the rep who promised $45.99 plan. I was told that they will check the recorded conversation and get back with me. I called several times for the past 4 weeks but I was not able to get a call back from Comcast.

325273,Comcast Blocking UDP Port 443,6/5/2015,1:02:10 PM,Internet,Arlington,Virginia,22206,Closed,Yes,"I work for the federal government and am the CIO of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). We support a large telework contingent. Two days ago our VOIP access from home to TTB stopped working for our users that have Comcast as an ISP. It continues to work for all other users that have a different ISP. All other services over Comcast work (i.e. laptop VPN that uses TCP port 443). We have an in-house Internet test system that shows UDP Port 443 being blocked. We also see this on our Internal VOIP logs. My fundamental issue (other than it not working) is that there is no way for a TTB network engineer to work with Comcast to resolve this on behalf of our users. The only way to get support is to have each individual contact Comcast directly. Since the users have no technical network knowledge, they get the script reading support people and a session that ends with we (Comcast) changed nothing and the issue is yours. That ignores the simple fact that it has worked for years and years and continues to work for anyone that has a different ISP. Any help appreciated.
 I have the issue at my home (the account number provided) but am filing on behalf of my employees that are affected. I listed the name of one employee that worked with Comcast. The Comcast rep was good, but the problem is not resolved. Ref CR

 Follow-up message by Consumer on 6/9/2015 11:58:38 AM:
 I was contacted last evening by a host of Comcast personnel. We received excellent support and the problem is resolved. For the record - the UDP port 443 traffic was making it out of the Comcast network but was not making it to TTB. Another provider between Comcast and TTB implemented a security fix last week that caused the issue. Comcast worked directly with that provider and caused the issue to be fixed. We are appreciative of this level of support and Comcast has requested that I use the contacts provided in the event of a similar issue in the future. This addresses all issues in my complaint.
 Thank you to Comcast and thank you to the FCC for the support in resolving our issue."
342435,Issues with Comcast,6/15/2015,10:39:15 PM,Internet,Arlington,Virginia,22206,Solved,No,"Ongoing issues with service and billing since January 2013.
 We have had repeated issues with Comcast's Internet and Television services. We are on our 5th router, our 3rd cable box and still routinely do not receive hi-speed internet or have issues with our cable TV. We have wasted many hours of our time dealing with representatives over the phone, as well as wasted many hours with technicians coming to our residence and telling us that everything is fine and that the problem has been resolved.
 We are just now beginning to experience the same level of incompetence with their billing department. We spoke with Comcast billing back in February 2015 because our bill had been raised $80 since we first started with Comcast. We were assured that Comcast wanted to keep us and would lower our bill to $150. That did not happen. We called back on May 24, as our bill had now crept even higher to $110 more than we had first agreed to, at $210.78. We were told the same thing, that Comcast wanted to keep us, and that with removing a movie package and applying a promotional offer they could get us down to $154.99. I asked for and received the name and badge number of the representative and was assured I would be receiving an email confirming the change.
 The next day, we received an email stating that our bill was now $163.26 effective immediately. As our movie package was gone, we expected that we had finally been given a lower rate. This did not happen and our bill for this month is the higher rate. We called back on June 15, and were told they had no record of this change. Even with the name and badge number of the previous person we had spoken with the billing department said they could not be of assistance and would have to transfer us to another department. We sat on hold for 5 minutes before we were told by an automated message that the department was closed for the evening and to call back the next day. I called back immediately to speak with billing and was told that yes, the department I needed to speak with was closed.

356118,"Comcast - failure to provide service, refusal to void contract",6/22/2015,2:41:05 PM,Internet,Arlington,Virginia,22206,Solved,No,"We have had high speed internet service (and cable) with Comcast since October of 2014 in Arlington, VA. We have continually had problems with the internet service - it goes in and out constantly and even when it is ""on"" - it is insanely slow - so slow that a speed tracker website cannot even load to track it (slower than dial up was in 1995 - really). I have called several times, several technicians have come out, and each time they check everything, say the signal is working perfectly, and that it must be a problem with our laptops/phones/modem/router, etc. We've replaced equipment, tried the connection with about a dozen different devices, to no avail. Most recently, we had a technician out on 6/18/15, who spent two hours, could not figure out the problem, but promised that a manager would be coming over on Sunday morning. We communicated on Friday, 6/19 about setting up an appointment for a manager to come out. I was continuously promised that a manager would be coming on Sunday morning, or calling - but nobody showed up, nobody called. I called Comcast again early on 6/22 to cancel the internet service (since it hasn't ever worked and nobody seems able to fix it), but was told that an early termination fee would apply. I asked to speak to a manager, and I was told there was no way to avoid the early termination fee. I asked to speak to a manager, and I was told that I'd have to be put on a list to receive a call back. I have not heard back. As of now, I have no internet service, have been continuously attempting to get them to fix it for almost 9 months, to no avail, and now am being told that to cancel a service that I've been paying for but not receiving, I'm going to have to pay more to just simply cancel it. We do not have any other cable service provider in the area, but I was planning on getting Verizon DSL.

363869,Spotty Comcast service,6/25/2015,8:03:27 AM,Internet,Arlington,Virginia,22202,Solved,No,"I pay almost $70 a month for internet from Comcast and I am regularly, (ie 2-4 times a week, some times multiple times within a day) notified by my alarm company that my internet is out. It isn't my equipment, it's the signal being dropped from the modem. Some times it comes back after a few seconds and other times it take 10-20 minutes to get a good, stable internet connection. Lately, the connection has been so unstable that my phone automatically turns WiFi off. Also, I've had to tell my Alarm company to ""ignore the communication error"" because it was become so frequent.
 This is all very, very frustrating because I don't have any other options for broadband and the basic speed that Comcast offers. Let me say that again, I don't have any other options, and Comcast has told me as much when I have called to complain.

369398,without service despite willingness to pay,6/26/2015,9:09:12 PM,Internet,Arlington,Virginia,22204,Open,No,"A couple of days ago, my Comcast service (high-speed internet + cable TV) was suspended because I have a past due amount of $202 that I wasn't able to pay by the deadline. I work part time and I was out sick many days, which means I didn't get paid for those days and my latest paychecks were lower than usual. I contacted Comcast's regional headquarters in MD to make payment arrangements. I first asked if I could pay the $202 in two different installments from two different paychecks, but I was told I needed to pay the full amount to be reconnected. So, I agreed to pay the $202 on July 3rd when I get my next paycheck. It's a stretch but I absolutely need at least the Internet to be restored ASAP because I'm taking online classes to pass a math placement test that I need to take at my university in order to be able to sign up for any classes for Fall 2015. I also do freelance graphic/web design work and that helps me make ends meet. However, the customer service executive told me I needed to pay the $202 by July 1st because on that day the system would generate a new bill and at that point I would owe $348 and $202 would no longer be enough to reconnect my service. He allegedly couldn't circumvent or override the system manually. Now, I think this is ridiculous. It's just a matter of 48 hours!!! Plus, it's strange that an executive has no control over an automated system. I don't get to decide when I receive my paychecks and it's not like I was unwilling to pay my past due amount. I won't be able to pay $348 on July 3rd because my paycheck will only be in the $500 range -- as I said before, paying $202 is already a stretch. That means that I won't be able to get my service back for most of the month of July and I've been a Comcast customer for 12 years!!! If I can't study for my test now, I'll end up taking it in August when all classes will be full and I might end up losing my financial aid and having to apply to the university again! I'll definitely seek legal advice and sue Comcast if that ends up being the case, but I hope this complaint will be enough for them to contact me and accept a $202 payment on July 3rd to reconnect my service. One last thing: whenever I ask to be switched to a cheaper plan or cancel my cable TV, I'm told I need to pay my full balance before I can make any changes to my service. And any plan for existing customers is much more expensive than the deals that new customers get. This company doesn't seem to value its long-time customers at all, yet, it has been overcharging us for years and we're the reason why it's so rich. I would gladly switch providers if I could, but in my particular area Comcast is sadly the only option for high-speed internet...

 Request #424671 ""Horrible Customer Service"" was closed and merged into this request. Last comment in request #424671:
 I'm writing to follow up on my Comcast disconnection odyssey. After filing numerous complaints, last night I was contacted by phone by an alleged Comcast executive who identified herself as ""Stacy"" (no last name).
 ""Stacy""'s reason for not wanting to restore my service is that I ""promised"" to pay the $139 on July 17, but I didn't, so that's a breach of contract and I will never have my service restored until I pay in full. She couldn't care less that I could pay that amount only on August 14, and by then it wouldn't be enough to get me back on because a new bill would be generated and the past due would increase. When I told her that I can't afford to be without the internet for so long because I need it for work, she had the nerve to say that my internet is ""for entertainment"". Says who? I freelance and I occasionally work from home for my part-time job, too. I don't own a business, so it's more cost effective for me to (b) (6)
 (b)
 (6)
 (b) (6)
 just pay for residential high speed internet than a business plan. Ms. ""Stacy"" doesn't live with me and has no right to infer that I use my internet ""for entertainment"" -- she can't possibly know how much time I spend on it working or studying vs watching cat videos on YouTube!
 Also, just to clarify, I never ""promised"" to pay the whole $139 on July 17. I said that would be the first day I could make a payment because I was getting a paycheck, and I did mean to pay as much as I could, but my electricity would be shut off if I didn't pay at least $70 and that took priority. At least, Dominion accepts payment arrangements and works with you splitting the payments as you can afford them.
 When I complained that I'm never allowed to downgrade my service and cancel my TV until I pay the full past due amount, ""Stacy"" said ""TV and internet is the same"" which is not because I would save $30 a month if I only paid for internet. Then she tried to blame me for not calling to cancel when the service is working as opposed to disconnected, which I have done an infinite number of times.
 In the end, she adamantly denied to restore my service and told me if I want to find a lawyer to help me with this, it's my right (but it didn't seem to concern her, as in her mind Comcast is right and maybe too powerful to be deterred by a lawsuit).
 I did let her know that this is very bad customer service and now I want to let the FCC, too.
 After this conversation, I called to cancel my service and the retention representative I spoke to had more common sense and waived the late fee on my past due because I've been with Comcast for 12 years and I'm behind - what? - maybe a month, month and a half? Big deal!
 I've really been through health issues and financial hardship and all I'm asking is to get at least my internet restored so I can work from home and study online instead of losing money and falling behind with my classes and homework. I'm not asking to get away with not paying my past due. I will eventually catch up. What's the difference between paying half of it on July 31 and the other half on August 14 or paying all of it on August 14? In the end, Comcast would still receive the same amount that I owe.
 It may not be Comcast's policy to accommodate such payment arrangements, but life happens and customers can get ill, lose their jobs, have unexpected expenses, etc. (According to the office of the VA Attorney General, Comcast makes its own rules and there's no organization that has the power to oversee and regulate them -- if this is true, it's ridiculous! It gives corporations carte blanche to abuse customers as they please, which is unfair!)
 A company with a heart who really cares about its customers should have a policy in place to help and retain such customers during a rough patch.
 I know Comcast proudly offers high speed internet access for $10 a month to families with at least one child who qualifies for a free meal or a subsidized meal at school. That's great, but there are many more people who struggle financially and they have the same rights to access the internet, especially if they use it to work and study.
 From now on, I'll be happy to discourage anybody I know from signing up with Comcast or suggest they switch providers if they're lucky enough to have a choice (unfortunately, I'm not). I may not get
 my internet back, but I'll take advantage of every free wireless spot and my cell phone service to post my story to any available public forum so that everybody knows how horrible Comcast's customer service is. Well, not everybody is horrible -- the reps I talked to last night after ""Stacy"" called me (one from Retention and one from Collections) were actually pretty nice and reasonable, but they had their hands tied by company policies and couldn't do anything to help me restore my service.
 I know losing a customer is no big deal financially for a giant like Comcast, but business isn't just about money. It's also about ethics and satisfying/retaining customers.
 I wish I had the option of switching providers, but where I live I'm stuck with Comcast, at least for high-speed internet, and I need to solve my case ASAP. I have to work and study and can't wait until August 14 (provided they accept a $128 payment to restore my service then...).

 Request #413640 ""Disconnected again!"" was closed and merged into this request. Last comment in request #413640:
 So, only a few days after solving my previous complaint and restoring my service, Comcast suspended it again because I have a $138.00 past due. I already told the executive who looked into my case when I filed my previous complaint that I'm going through a time of financial hardship due to illness (though I do have a professional job, I'm part time and paid by the hour, so I don't get paid sick leave). I was hoping I could make the payment last Friday when I got my paycheck, but I had to catch up with my electric bill and only have $11 in my account left. I won't be able to pay the $138 until August 31 when I get my next paycheck and even then, I can only make a partial payment because I was sick and my paycheck will only be $300. However, I need the internet restored ASAP to follow my online class and do freelance design work. I've asked Comcast multiple times to let me cancel my cable TV, which would make it easier for me to catch up with my payments, but they always refused, saying I need to pay all my past due amount first. This is like a vicious circle and I'm tired of filing complaints and begging to have my service restored.

226231,Issues with Xfinity/Comcast,4/9/2015,12:24:32 PM,Internet,Arlington Heights,Illinois,60004,Closed,No,"I've had a number of issues with Xfinity in the last month. Not only service that wasn't working for almost a month, rude customer service reps, promised packages that I was later told ""don't exsist"" and hidden charges on my account I was told would be credited to my account, then weeks later were still on my account and no one ""Could help me"" review those credits.
 They sent out a tech who was late, stayed over 3 hours, wouldn't take my equipment and then proceeded to tell me they gave me a package that doesn't exsist and he couldn't set up my services and refused to take my broken equipment. I was charged $70 for this visit without my knowledge. I was told by a supervisor that the fee would be refunded since it was never disclosed and I never signed or agreed to this. A month later the fee is still on the account and no one will help me. When I called today the rep wouldn't let me talk to a supervisor, told me no one is available to help me, talked so rudely to me then hung up on me. I'm sick of the run around and I don't understand how they can lie so many times and charge people hidden fees.

241880,Cable Modem rent for Internet access,4/17/2015,3:48:16 PM,Internet,Arlington Heights,Illinois,60004,Closed,No,"I think more than 8 years ago and with little interruptions, I have had contract with COMCAST as Internet Service Provider. As I remember, at the beginning with COMCAST the monthly rent payment for a CABLE MODEM was $5 a month. On December 2014, due to some difficulties to access the Internet, I was recommended by COMCAST'S Customer Service to replace the Cable Modem for a new one. Then I decided to stop the Cable Modem renting way from COMCAST and to buy a new one with my own money, and to return the obsolete Cable Modem to COMCAST. After getting the next COMCAST'S monthly bill, I was really so surprised: $8 less to pay, then I got some questions that are the reason of this Complaint: 1. Do COMCAST have been charging $5 or more than that to the customers, for a depreciated and obsolete electronic device? 2. If it is true, is it Legal to increase the rent price for an electronic device that at the same time is becoming obsolete? 3. In my opinion a Company who rents an electronic device, should decrease the rent just as the electronic device become obsolete. In my case I think that in average I have paid more than $600 for an electronic device that I guess it would cost $40 or les for an Internet Service Provider. Are there Legal Regulations to protect the customers for this kind of situations or am I completely wrong on everything? I APPRECIATE TO FCC, FOR GIVING US THE CITIZENS THE POSSIBILITY TO EXPRESS OUR CONCERNS. THANK YOU SO MUCH!

231273,Comcast's Monopolistic Practices and Data Capping,4/12/2015,3:22:03 PM,Internet,Atlanta,Georgia,30315,Closed,No,"In light of the vote by the FCC to protect a free and open internet I would like to file a complaint about Comcast's use of internet usage caps in the Atlanta market.
 The current caps are set at a lower level than should be realistically acceptable in today's world of high-quality video streaming and cloud-based computing+storage.
 Furthermore, the current caps set by Comcast vary from market to market. Atlanta customers are paying the exact same price for capped data than customers in markets with unlimited data. We should not get markedly poorer service for identical costs.
 While I understand the need to have rules to deter serial bandwidth abusers, I feel that the current caps in the Atlanta market are in place due to a virtual monopoly. This observation is backed up by Comcast's sudden announcement of unlimited, uncapped 2gps fiber service coming soon to Atlanta, which would never have happened had Google Fiber not announced its far more competitive plans there in the future. Obviously if Comcast can offer uncapped 2Gps service to an estimated 18MM users, it is not nearly so strained for bandwidth that it must cap users at 300GB/mo. The cap is only viable due to their current monopoly.
 I am an ordinary consumer and not a business. However, I do two commonplace activities that shoot me far above Comcast's 300GB/mo cap:
 1) I stream Netflix TV shows a few days a week
 2) I use cloud-based backup services for my computer
 Backing up your computer is an absolute necessity. However, my laptop has a 1TB hard drive, so I end up needing to upload nearly 400GB just to back up my personal photos, videos, and documents - some of the most important things in my life.
 Data caps are anti-competition, are counter to our country's values about a free and open internet, are inflicted on users who initially signed contracts offering uncapped services, and are set at an unreasonably low bar.
 Please investigate Comcast's use of data caps in Atlanta and move to prevent these anti-consumer actions.

231377,Comcast billing problem,4/12/2015,6:18:10 PM,Internet,Atlanta,Georgia,30308,Closed,No,"On December 20, 2014, I realized my introductory year on my Comcast Internet plan would end in January 2015. I decided to call Comcast to discuss options for the upcoming year of 2015 for my Internet service. I webchatted with Hittesh, the customer service representative. This is the copied part of our webchat that clarifies our agreement (screenshot attached): â€œ, I have checked for you and I am not getting anything lower then your current package price with same package internet plus. However I can give you same package of $ 39.99 for next 12 months from today onwards. It will stay same till next year 12/20/2015. How this sound?â€ We agreed to these terms, and he assured me this would be included on my account.
 Then, I received my bill in January 2015 in the amount of $62.59. The monthy bill should have been the same as in 2014, which was $52.65. (There are changes for a modem lease and tax on top of the aforementioned $39.99 package price.)
 On February 2, I spoke with a few personnel to clear up the issue. I had the screen shot (attached) as evidence of the agreement Hittesh and I had reached, so I thought it was a simple mistake in the system. The personnel went on to tell me that it was a mistake on the part of customer service and could not be allowed by the billing department, that the $62.59 bill was the lowest they could offer me. They routed me to a few people in different departments and even told me I needed to call customer service and â€œrenegotiateâ€ the terms with them (which they also conflictingly told me would be impossible to â€œenforceâ€ in billing regardless). The people I spoke with include Alexandra (AD4) and Javier Cavalie in the billing department (direct line at 954.534.7151). Javier assured me he would resolve the issue and get back with me, telling me I could call him directly. He then went on to ignore my phone messages and never got back in touch. This is one of the worst customer service experiences I have had, but of course there are few options for Internet service.
 My compliant is that even with documentation (attached) of an agreement between customer service and a customer, Comcast does not uphold their own self-made commitment. Please let me know if there is anything that can be done.
 Many thanks,

 town for 4 days. I looked back at the last 3 months and had used 129,139 and 164 GBs during those
 months. So this is very strange and suspicious to me. I posted questions about this to my
 neighborhood email group, and many people said this has happened to them as well. I won't be
 charged for the overage this time, but I really don't want this to happen again...and there is no other
 good choice for service."

 the next day I check my balance. It states my balance is $0.00. Now I am being charged for not
 paying my bill in full. Due to the fact that this happen last month I took screen shots of each step of
 this process. If you need this information please feel free to contact me.
 When I did contact Comcast they tell me that it is my fault. They tell me its my fault because I do not
 receive paper bill. They told me because I choose not to receive paper bills the bill is not generated
 properly. They told me my internet bill will never be generated propely. So because I want to use
 paperless billing and save trees I am being punished.
 I need my bill fixed. I need to people at Comcast to work with me. There is obviously a glarying hole
 in their system and they dont care.

 behavior must not be tolerated."
278509,Data caps,5/7/2015,2:55:45 PM,Internet,Atlanta,Georgia,30363,Open,No,"These data caps on Comcast are becoming a burden. In the age of steaming, working from home
 and Internet gaming - we are at a place where data caps can become costly fast for just casually
 using Internet. For example Comcast has a 300gb cap. Netflix happened to release an array of shoes
 while my roommate was watching his shows on Hulu on his computer and the other roommate was
 studying for his gmat with you tube videos. This happens almost daily and puts us around 700gb+!
 Now that totals to almost $100 in overage charges and the base we pay for TV and Internet is only
 $80! That's insane! We use Internet as a form of communication and as such that's the equivalent
 here of buying cable TV but they limit you to 40 hours of TV time a month. It's insane, I know that it's
 not because of infrastructure issues because they've not been enforcing this cap for years and
 recently implemented it a year ago! We are still getting similar unreliable speeds but now we're being
 charged more. I really am hoping for the FCC to take a stand here and really ban the use of datacaps
 on home broadband internet! On top of that prevent the collusion of ISPs in order to generate
 competition!"

 additional $10/month. I declined the service. Several months later when reviewing my cable bills, I
 noticed the service had been added to my account and I was being charged the additional fees.
 I've called Comcast to demand a refund. They noted my complaint and said they would review it in
 24-48 hours. I had no other recourse to get my money back than to wait 2 days and call back."
288771,Comcast Misled With Overage Policy,5/13/2015,7:55:53 PM,Internet,Atlanta,Georgia,30317,Open,No,"Last year Comcast implemented a new billing scheme where they cap monthly internet usage at 300
 gigabytes. Once the 300 gigabytes is reached Comcast charges $10 for each additional 50 gigabytes
 used. Per year, each customer is allowed 3 months where the 300 gigabyte threshold may be
 surpassed without penalty. I spoke with a Comcast representative last year who informed me that
 after 1 calendar year from my last free overage month, my 3 free months would reset. However, this
 did not occur and I am now told that my 3 free months, that should reset each year, will never return. I
 spoke with a Comcast rep last week that apologized on behalf of the company and said the policy
 was misleading and that in fact if you exhaust your 3 overage months and then go over 300 gigabytes
 the following month, it will not reset. However, this information is not to be found anywhere in
 Comcast's overage policy and was not presented as such when I spoke at length with representatives
 a year ago. This is a poor and misleading practice. The only remedy is for Comcast to honor their
 policy as presented on their website and reset the 3 courtesy overage months. Thank you.

 I'm here to file a complaint due to the 350GB data cap Comcast has enforced in Atlanta Georgia. With
 a $10 overage charge for every 50GB used after. Due to the cap I've had to limit using internet
 streaming services. I've discontinued my accounts with Netflix, WWE Network, Hulu, and also
 Crunchy Roll. With all services offering HD contact having a cap of that size is ludicrous. I would like
 to see the cap discontinued."

 representative confirmed to me that it would be cancelled, but I was still being charged.
 I called again on May 22, 2015 after I received another bill. I was redirected multiple times, only to be
 abruptly hung up.
 Comcast continues to charge me for service and will not let me end it, even though I no longer reside
 at the service address."
304450,Data Caps,5/23/2015,12:05:55 AM,Internet,Atlanta,Georgia,30318,Open,No,"It is unnecessary and ridiculous to put an artificial cap on wired internet usage. I am not allowed to
 freely consume data without worrying about whether it will impact my ""data usage"" which is simply an
 artificial limit placed on a service that never had any limits. Providing additional GB of data costs
 cents on the dollar and I am being charge $10 every time I over step my bounds and only get 50 GB
 for that $10. Additionally, I do not get a credit on my bill for data under 300 GB per month. If data is so
 scarce why not roll over or actually credit us for unused precious data.
 It is theft to charge for an increment that is not used wholly. There is no money back for using less
 than the additional 50 GB provided. The logic is not there.
 The only thing this is used for is to create artificial scarcity and higher revenue for cable companies. It
 is so infuriating that these companies dictate how much data I can consume. ""Land of the free"" more
 like ""Land of the FEE"".
 Something needs to be done about cable companies fucking over regular americans. I am glad Tom
 Wheerler is taking a stand, but data caps are ridiculous, especially in a world where data
 consumption is only growing.
 Companies want to condition user to paying for data just like they did with cell phones. Please dont
 let US consumers get screwed by these companies' greed."

 March 25. When I got up that morning, my internet, television and phone line were disconnected. I
 called, but was on hold for an inordinate amount of time. I then chose the phone payment option by
 check because I was afraid my clients would call and get a ""disconnected"" message and I would lose
 my customers. When I paid the check by phone, I was forced to indicate that I accepted that I would
 pay a disconnection fee of an unstated amount. I do not believe my service should have been
 disconnected because ""due on March 25"" meant I could pay on that day.

 Hi, I am having a very difficult time speaking directly to anyone from Comcast. Their representative
 called me on June 4. I called on June 8 and left a detailed voicemail. She called again on the 7th. I
 couldnâ€™t pick up the phone because I was driving and called right back. Voicemail again and I left a
 detailed message. She sent an email saying they were following up. She called again on June 9th. I
 tried to call right back and got voicemail again. Left another detailed message. Same thing again on
 yesterday, June 11th. I immediately called back and got voicemail and left a detailed message. Then
 they had a computer call me saying to indicate that I wanted to discuss my bill. It is an unfair
 expectation that I can immediately pick up the phone when they call. When I am not able to do this I
 lose my opportunity to talk about the problem because the calls all go to voicemail. Discussing my bill
 is not my problem. My problem as described in the complaint is that they disconnected my service on
 the day the bill was due per their written communication to me. They forced me to pay a reconnect
 fee and increased my monthly rate. Their behavior is for the purpose of creating the illusion that they
 are helping. I donâ€™t think they intend to do anything but steal my money and hope you will not notice.

 which hurts consumers. As we increasingly become more digital (think 4k streaming, live tv
 streaming, on demand service, digital purchases of movies and games, working from home), we
 require more bandwidth. With all these on demand services, I've been hitting the 300gb limit within a
 week or two! There were times where I had to decline purchasing a digital game because I did not
 have enough data remaining (unless I pay for overages of course). This is price gouging at its worst
 and it's only hurt consumers, and in some ways the economy. This has to stop."

308171,Unbelievable Treatment,5/26/2015,6:40:25 PM,Internet,Atlanta,Georgia,30310,Solved,No,"I am getting overcharged with comcast / xfinity. I had cable, internet, phone with them at one point
 thinking that it was as great customer service company because there service was always great. I
 have my service for about six months and kept noticing that the bill was changing and that it was
 never caught up. They would tell me that my services were about to get interrupted by mail. Then
 other times I would just be turned off in the middle of the day. I was on the phone almost every week
 with a issue with comcast. I would call and get hung up on my the employees ALL THE TIME. I would
 ask to speak to someone in charge and I would be hung up on as they were acting as if it was a tech
 problem but I would call weeks apart and the same thing. I would call back and call back until I got
 someone. Sometimes being on hold for 45 mins only to be hung up on and would have to call back.
 One day i spent my ENTIRE evening trying to call them. I would tell them that they were overcharging
 me. They would talk down to me and try to get smart with me and tell me to get money and pay them.
 They would say on occasions that it doesn't matter because I was going to have to pay it anyway
 because they would only take money off my next bill if they admitted they were at fault. I then decided
 to down grade to just internet and deal with Netflix and Apple TV rather than deal with them. The day
 I was getting my down grades I found out for the past 6 months that I was getting charged for like 4
 services I wasn't even getting and all they did was drop the amount that they charged forgetting that I
 was telling them and they were failing to listen. That they wouldn't take my calls and would hang up
 on me.
 Now I am on my last straw. I was on my computer this morning to see that the internet had went out. I
 knew I had to pay the internet today and had just got the money to pay them the night before i went to
 the bank to put in the money and looked at my bill at work to see that I was owing them double the
 amount than usual. Last month my services just STOPPED working and I called there tech line and
 they couldn't fix the problem for me. So they told me that they would send someone out to my house
 to fix my problem. The guy came over to my house to check my lines out the when I pulled in the
 driveway the guy was nice and said, ""Did you set this up like this."" I told him no, that the guy who
 installed my cable did it. He said it was all jacked up and wrong. He went to his car and put a new end
 on my cable line. I told him I was glad that he came and fixed the problem. Ever since then I haven't
 had any problems with my service. Now I understand why it would go in and out when it would storm
 at my house. It was a messed up line that they installed wrong. I got cut off this morning to see that
 my bill was double. It was double because they charged me a hidden fee of $70 that was NEVER,
 NEVER, EVER discussed for the tech coming out. I have been on the phone with comcast hold
 message with the symphony and the guitar since 4:16 and I have been hung up on, told to just pay it
 cause talking to billing isn't going to do anything about this pass due balance. Got hung up on billing
 and customer service reps 5 times already. I am still on hold and each call has been at least a 20-45
 min hold each time you get transferred. They do not care about me or how about there employees
 treat me."

311725,Comcast's Terrible Service - How are they still in business?,5/28/2015,2:46:47 PM,Internet,Atlanta,Georgia,30309,Solved,No,"Today, 5/28/15, is the 6th time we've called Comcast regarding install of internet in my new home.
 What is worst of all is that I originally called on 5/12/15 to ensure proper connection and avoid
 disruption in my service. I was told it would be an easy switch that we'd be able to self install and
 there wouldn't be any problems. Definitely not the case. Internet didn't work as soon as we got to our
 house. It's been 7 days since I moved in and I still don't have internet, but more than that - I have not
 heard truth from ANY of the company's representatives - even supervisors. When you call them, it
 says, ""We make it easy for you to move to your new home. With convenient date selections to have a
 professional come to your home on the same day."" Such lies.
 The first time we called, we were told it is that our modem is no longer supported so we had to go out
 to buy a new modem, only to find that our internet STILL did NOT work.
 Since then, we've had 3 appointments set up for a dispatcher to come to our home; 1 of the
 appointments/calls, they apparently have no record of and 2 were no-shows. Thus far, we've spoken
 to 2 supervisors; one of which even gave us his personal phone # to ensure ""we are taken care of
 and treated properly"" and that a tech would show up. Still no show.
 Was about to post a bad review/note on Facebook to see if it would catch their attention, only to find
 negative posts on the ENTIRE page regarding Comcast's Customer Service. How is this okay? How
 can a company see no value in providing even the most basic level of customer service to their
 paying customers? In a world where endless options are available, it seems Comcast can only get
 away with this because there is almost a monopoly in the cable/internet industry with only 2 providers
 available.
 FCC - Comcast needs to be reprimanded and held to a higher standard of customer service. They
 cannot continue to get away with this.
 I just canceled my service."

 owe them any money
 In the event that later Comcast is involved in a billion dollar class action suit the business executives
 will get the money, but what about me the customer that they haven't taken money from, forced
 payment, and disconnected my services for no reason.
 I expect the FCC to address this issue now before it gets to class action because as a consumer I am
 sure I will never see a dime of the class action settlement.
 This has been a repeat pattern with Comcast of cutting me off for no reason and demanding payment
 before services will be restored. I am a student, work from home, and a rapper that utilizes the
 internet daily. By suspending me they are forcing me to make a payment of monies that I don't owe.

 after two weeks the issue has not been fixed. This has precluded me from obtaining internet, phone,

 them to simply change the service account for my address to my name. No less than seven
 phonecalls, 4 emails, and one visit to a brick and mortar have been made by me over the past two
 weeks to no avail. The prior tenant can not be reached by either the apartment complex or Comcast;

I paid 10 additional dollars per month for this privilege. My intent/cable TV bill averages ~ 140.00 per month. Service became so spotty and slow that it became almost useless. Made multiple calls to tech support, replaced my wireless access point with a new one. Ultimately Comcast came out to my apartment complex, fixed the problem and charged me 70.00 to come out.
 I called tonight to inquire as to why. I called at 6:43 PM, and was offered the option for someone to call me back in 5-7 mins rather than stay on hold. I chose this option. When there was no call, I called back at 7:08. I stayed on hold until 7:15 PM, when they called me back. I stayed on hold another 7 minutes until 7:22. I voiced my displease and asked to speak to a supervisor and was denied this opportunity. I was told I was responsible for the bill because it was my problem. I asked why it was my problem when it was their damn equipment and was chastised for using foul language. I never got to speak to a supervisor, and was told she was in Florida and could't assist me.
 I sent an email to corporate, but based on their lack of customer service, I doubt I will receive a response. Google internet can't get here fast enough. This monopoly is awful. They don't care. There needs to be competition and they need to be forced to provide the service that I am forced to pay high rates for. AT&T can't compete with their speed. They know they are the only real game in town. Therefore they are unresponsive.
 I expect relief. I shouldn't have to pay 70.00 for them to repair their system. Let alone the poor customer service and the waste of my time. Unbelievable.

325596,Horrible Comcast Customer Service,6/5/2015,2:46:43 PM,Internet,Atlanta,Georgia,30339,Solved,No,"My family recently moved to a new apartment and decided to open a Comcast account. My wife spoke with the representative to get the account set up as I'd be moving ahead of her and would need to take care of getting things set up. She scheduled an appointment with Comcast to get our internet started the exact same day I'd be moving in. That morning I received a call from a Comcast technician asking about my appointment later in the day, and after a brief discussion in which I told him I already had all the necessary equipment personally and I just needed the line activated, I was told to cancel my appointment as a technician visit would not be necessary. After arriving at the new apartment I attempted to hook up to Comcast exactly as I should and found I had no service. I made multiple calls to Comcast and after roughly 90 minutes on the phone being bounced around and given all sort of incorrect information and suggestions I ended up at a manager who told me they'd have a technician out the in a few days. At the time the second technician was supposed to show up, the technician never showed and after multiple hours more of calling support, multiple supervisors, and multiple support technicians giving me blatantly wrong information and one all but calling me a liar, I got another service appointment set up and was told that I would not be charged for any of the 3 total technician visits, including the two no-shows. At this point I had been without internet for multiple days, all of which was impeding my ability to do my job, which I had repeatedly mentioned to Comcast was an issue and it was their technician in the first place that prevented my access to the internet. The final technician visit went smoothly and the technician even went so far as to show me on his data pad my file on the company where it blatantly stated that my apartment was not connected and a tech still needed to finish up the wiring. The tech they sent out completed the wiring and I was able to connect. Apparently this part of my file should have been available to all levels that helped me and further alerted me to the fact that either nobody at Comcast knows what they're doing or they just don't care and were trying to string me along until I stopped complaining. Now over a month later I'm finding that Comcast is still attempting to charge me for one of the service visits, despite their statement that they would not. I've attempted to reach them regarding my bill but have been hung up on by their system on multiple occasions. Unfortunately in my area Comcast is the only ISP that is able to offer the speeds needed for my work so I'm stuck dealing with their awful customer service and business practices.

 I have had an very poor experience with comcast as an internet provider and their poor communication and lack of follow through is the worst customer service I have ever encountered. On Thursday June 11th I placed a call in which a customer service representative instructed me I could cancel my service at the end of the month and drop off my cable box at my convenience with continuation of my internet service. The following day the box was turned in and to my surprise they discontinued my internet service as well. When I called they said it was because I did not pay my bill (though I am on auto-pay). Over the next two days I spent 3-4 hours on the phone and no one was able to re issue my service. They said they would call yesterday and no one has contacted me. Being that I work at the hospital and manage patient care it is extremely important that I access patient records during any time of the day or night. Because of this inconvenience it has caused a lot of problems for me.

This cannot be legal and I would change service but Comcast has a monopoly in my area and no other providers can offer service here. Please help to resolve this immediately as I need internet service from my home to conduct business.

 My complaint has not been resolved and should not be closed since I have received another notice from them today about being charged for being over my data limit. They cannot even show me what this data usage is supposedly from and I do not believe it is true since it is only myself and my daughter in the home. (b) (6)

350016,Comcast refuses service to my address,6/18/2015,4:45:38 PM,Internet,Atlanta,Georgia,30318,Solved,No,"Comcast- Xfinity.com
 Atlanta, Georgia
 On May 16 2015, I tried to sign for high speed internet service. Unfortunately, I was told that the service was unavailable. It was a big surprise that in Midtown Atlanta in a street where my next door neighbor has the Comcast Xfinity connection, I could not have the same service.
 I called (800) 934-6489 and the time spent on the phone was 58 minutes. After I answered so many questions without success, the person on the line asked the supervisor who also gave the same result that service was unavailable at my house without explaining why others on the same street have service.
 The person from Comcast recommended Charter as alternative. Charter mentioned that Xfinity is supposed to have the service. They recommended I should go to the store and present a utility bill to and my lease to the property. I went the Xfinity store and opened a ticket (erone 029015327). It requested that a technician check the area and tell me an answer. The nightmare started. I gave enough days to see it was solved. I never saw a person or received a call. I called back and the answer was that the ticket was closed. The Xfinity representative Kenyata (I.D. mo-inkinley) reopened a ticket, but again nobody showed up.
 On May 21 2014 I decided to give another call, and after 37 minutes Andres (I.D. acampo 033), did the same thing, but he mentioned that now the technician was supposed to come and check the situation. He said that in 15 minutes he would called me back to decide in which program package I was interested. He never called back. I have read many reviews that Comcast Xfinity has a terrible service. At this time I can agree that all the information spread on the internet is real. It is terrible that they lie and treat me as a second class person. I am frustrated that nobody is there to provide help.
 Last week a person from Comcast Xfinity parked in a van on Westshire Place gave me a better answer. He said that my house has a â€œTAP BOXâ€, and should be able to have a high speed connection. He could not solve the issue because it was not his division, but he said that will make (b) (6)
 the request to his supervisor. Nothing came out. Today another technician, whom also I found working near the area, came to check the pole outside the house. Again, he said that there is a tap box to connect, but he could not do anything, because work required a ticket. He did not know who to contact at Comcast Xfinity
 Because the lack of response of Comcast Xfinity, and there is no way that I can directly request that a technician visit the site,I will really appreciate it if you will help to resolve the problem to obtain an internet connection.

349567,Comcast will not let me discuss my bill or service with a representative,6/18/2015,3:36:45 PM,Internet,Atlanta,Georgia,30324,Solved,No,"I ordered Comcast cable and internet service in late April 2015, to be installed at 2450 Camellia Lane NE #1359, Atlanta, GA 30324. Comcast was supposed to mail me the equipment for self-installation, but I did not receive the equipment. I called again three weeks later, and Comcast gave me the run-around, telling me to file a claim with UPS and wait for that to clear up, which I did. Comcast finally resent the equipment a week later. The equipment Comcast sent did not work. I had to drive to a Comcast location and pick up functional equipment myself. I was able to install it, but I requested that my bill be modified to reflect that I did not have working Comcast equipment or service for over a month. A Comcast representative told me she would change the bill at my request and prorate the billing cycle to reflect the days where I actually had working Comcast equipment and service. However, this month I received a new bill with a past due amount plus a current due amount and a late charge. I want to understand the bill, because I believe Comcast made a mistake and added on the amount for the time period where I did not have equipment or service. I've called Comcast more than 10 times to speak to a representative. Every time I call, I get an automatic message that I have an unpaid balance -- I then request to speak to a representative, and Comcast then hangs up on me. I've called from a cell phone and a landline, so I know the problem isn't my cell phone dropping the call. I've only been able to speak to a Comcast representative by selecting a service other than the option to discuss my bill -- I was able to speak to a Comcast representative twice by selecting the ""Pay Your Bill Now"" option and the ""Add Services"" option. Each time I told the representative I wanted to discuss an error on my bill, they hung up on me. And since my bill is unpaid, my internet service cuts off frequently. It basically appears that Comcast is purposely not allowing me to speak to a representative about my bill unless I pay the full amount first, which, again, I believe is in error. And it seems like Comcast is purposely making my internet service fail while the bill is unpaid (since I had no problems before the bill was past due). At this point, I want my bill to be fixed, so that I can pay the amount due and cancel Comcast. But, again, the Comcast customer service line hangs up on me every time I call.

354254,Comcast TV/Internet hookup,6/20/2015,7:16:33 PM,Internet,Atlanta,Georgia,30341,Solved,No,"I have had three different issues trying to get my TV/Internet hooked, each more egregious than the one before it.
 The initial issue was that the sales person on the phone told me that I could use a home install kit, which was cheaper than getting the in home installation by an employee, even though it was a newly built home.
 Secondly, when I found I couldn't home install, they set me up for installation in my home and they basically told me that they could not credit me the cost of installation, but they would note my record. After receiving the first bill, I could call into billing and they would refund me the cost of the installation. I later spoke to someone in the billing department that said they would not honor that and I would not get refunded that if I called in after the first bill. The supervisor in Sales that told me I could get installation refunded had to know there was no way for me to actually get it refunded. I called back in to Sales, and the rep was able to refund me the installation cost (even though the previous supervisor said they could not do it).
 The final issue (and the most unbelievable) had to do with the actual installation. I purchased my own cable modem new from Amazon. When the installation tech showed up, I was not home but my dad was. He told my dad that the modem I had could not be activated on their network because it had previously been active. In addition he ""called"" into tech support and read the number out to ""someone"" on the other end of the phone call. He confirmed he could not activate it. He basically made us rent a cable modem from him.
 I did not understand this at all at the time, but trusted the guy enough to have Amazon send me a new cable modem. I decided to then call Comcast tech support and the support rep didn't understand why the intall rep would say that. He said that previously being on the network (if true, which it wasnt) was not a reason the device couldnt get on the network. he activated it with me over the phone in 10 minutes without issue. It is obvious that the install tech was lying and trying to upsell the cable modem. But he blatantly lied to us about it. The device was new and had never been on the network and even if it had, that was no reason for it to be an invalid modem. He obviously made some sort of a fake call to ""sell"" the fact that we had to rent a modem through Comcast. I have talked to a couple honest folks throughout this process, but also a couple that flat out lied to make a sell.

359260,Comcast speed integrity,6/23/2015,4:30:18 PM,Internet,Atlanta,Georgia,30308,Pending,No,"Originally I paid for a 25Mbps speed and was consistently and daily having this speed dip down to 150kb/s(1.2Mbps) for hours on end. Video streaming was impossible. I was called with an offer of 60 mbps upgrade, and once approved was billed for the new speed. Before the upgrade my speed had never been higher than 2.2Mb/s(17.5MBPS) and now my speed with the upgrade has never been over 2.4Mb/s(19.2MBPS) with it consistently and daily having this speed dip down to 150kb/s(1.2Mbps) for hours on end as well. I assumed that I would at least have these peaks and lows increase by a factor of 2.4 since I'm paying twice the price that I was paying. There have been no noticeable speed increases and my account is obviously throttled at peak times by a factor of 60. Congestion is not acceptable excuse for this since my internet becomes completely unusable almost daily. Also, the xfinity wifi is being broadcast from my modem after already being disabled once through my account. Now when I try to change it again to be disabled, an error appears not allowing the change no matter what device or network I do it from. Support told me that they changed it when i talked to them about it and it never has been fixed and is still broadcasting a public signal. This is unacceptable because if congestion is my problem, I should easily and freely be able to prevent others from accessing my overloaded access point. Furthermore, the other week I received a letter that my service is going up in price due to factors in my area, which is unacceptable because I was not even receiving the service I was paying for,

With other services, this would mean switching from this now very limited vendor to another without said restrictions. Unfortunately, Comcast has a monopoly over internet services in the Atlanta area. It appears that Comcast is putting these caps in place in order to push consumers away from bandwidth-intensive streaming services like Netflix or Amazon Prime Video and towards traditional cable television provided by - you guessed it - Comcast. The only consolation offered by Comcast is to sign up for one of their business plans which coincidentally have lower bandwidth/speed (making them unfriendly to those same video streaming services) despite their lack of data cap.

There was no charge, as they give users 3 courtesy overage months at no charge. However this month I have somehow gone over my 300GB data plan WITHOUT a large onedrive backup from the previous month... which has NEVER been an issue for me. They are saying I will be charged for usage of additional data. To my knowledge I should still have 2 courtesy overage months left. They have made zero effort to give warnings on data usage until its to late.. aka at 100% usage. This does not seem very fair.

 The $20.00 Credit was not only removed from my account, but they decided to tack on a late fee as well for a bill I was not even late. I would have never known about them
 Taking the credit back until I went to pay my bill. I called and complained because I feel I had every right to and they told me it was a ""one time courtesy"" bill adjustment. That is not a courtesy to my understanding when you take back a credit, add on a late fee and then not call or email the customer to explain anything! It is terrible customer service and not right to do to loyal customers at all!
 I called Byron Darby in the number provided on the letter reading the statement in the letter about trying to
 Contact me on the dates above which I have no record of in my phone or on my Verizon statement...I told him I would like to be provided proof of that. I also do not think it is lawful or right to apply a credit to a customers account and then take it back without warning and then charge a late fee because the payment was not seen as accurate without the credit, even if they had done so by mistake or did not mean to apply it.
 Thank you for addressing my concerns and for your quick response.

362223,Comcast bill,6/24/2015,2:43:13 PM,Internet,Atlanta,Georgia,30316,Solved,No,"I would like to file a formal complaint about the ever-increasing cost of my comcast service. I have been a comcast customer for several years at multiple properties mainly due to my lack of options. The monopoly that comcast is able to retain in some areas is unfair to the consumer and should be stopped. Admittedly, I do not 'NEED' cable but I work from home which mean I do 'NEED' the internet connection that I pay comcast for. I have attempted to cancel my cable subscription and keep only the internet but comcast insists on RAISING my bill if I drop the cable and only keep internet. Their logic makes no sense and their customer service is absolutely terrible. This is a common feeling among many comcast customers and I hope it is one day addressed.

365321,Comcast Refusing to Honor Internet Rate,6/25/2015,2:08:35 PM,Internet,Atlanta,Georgia,30324,Solved,No,"On June 12, 2015 I signed up for Comcast internet service for the first time (new customer) via the Comcast website. I signed up for a promotional internet offer for their ""Performance"" package (25 mbps) for $24.99 for the first 12 months.
 On June 22, 2015 I received my first bill for the service and noticed I was being charged $66.95 for the internet service instead of $24.99 as stated when I signed up. I called Comcast to address this issue and have had limited success in getting it resolved. After no fewer than 8 calls to Comcast customer support, I was redirected between the sales, online sales, billing, retention, and technical support departments, with each one telling me variations of the following: ""the offer is no longer available, [our department] can't fix this issue you need to contact [other department], we don't see the offer in our system so we cannot change your price, we can offer you another [more expensive] bundled internet and TV package, we can offer you a [slower] service for the same price"", and so forth.
 I have spent 5+ hours on the phone with various departments at Comcast and have still had no success in getting them to honor the rate I was told when I signed up for the service. I refuse to pay $41 more per month than I was told. I was either deliberately misled about the price of the service or Comcast is simply refusing to honor their own offers, either of which is unacceptable.
 I have attached screenshots of the offer I signed up for from the Comcast website, the terms and conditions of the offer, and another screenshot showing that the offer is for my address, clearly showing that the offer was valid at the time I signed up, for the specific service I signed up for, and offered at my specific address. Please do something with this information as seen fit.

 However, I was out of the United States at May 06 to China and come back at May 22. I was bring my laptop with me, so it is not possible that I used that large amount of data.
 Second, Comcast has mandatory Internet usage notification through my email account, which I received at March and I turn internet off in time to avoid the charge. However, Comcast didn't send me the notification email, which they should automatically, to inform me that it is out of usage limit.
 I called Comcast Costumer service more than 5 times, and their costumer service agents were not helping. Even when I asked one of agents, ""so I have to pay for the data that I never used? "" He answered me. "" Yes, sir. If Comcast charge you on the bill, you have to pay for that. We can't do anything about the rest.""
 Since they do record the phone for the business purpose, it should be easy to check the phone record.. the phone refer number is 654430.
 In the attachment, there is screenshot for my comcast email list. You can tell at the end of line it is internet usage notification email at March, and there is no further notification from May. If they think I delete the notification, they can pull out the email database at their side to check the email log, to figure out why they didn't send me the notification and charge me the additional usage.

 We are being billed $200 for 6 days of total service (internet and tv working). After complaining to FCC we spoke with Ms. D. Usher and she gave us $133 in credits, but is not able to fully explain why we are left with $77 in bills for 6 days of service. We are obviously not happy and want to cancel our service and are being charged an early termination fee of $115 on top of the charges we have already racked up. Again, we have had service a total of 6 days in full. Ms. Usher has informed us that we are 5 days out from when we could have backed out without a fee. I do not think Comcast has

 stood up to their end of the contract because we haven't had service for 30 days, and that we should be able to get out of it without paying the fee.

Using the internet at the average speed that I get, Comcast only provides me with 15 hours of internet usage per month included in my monthly bill before I am charged an additional $10 for every 2 and a half hours of additional internet. I telecommute as often as possible, both because I am disabled and driving is painful, and to save money. This is no longer a viable option with being charged impossible hidden costs.

372331,Comcast Data Caps,6/29/2015,1:49:15 PM,Internet,Atlanta,Georgia,30324,Pending,Yes,"Last year, Comcast notified us that we were going to have data caps of 300gb per month. These caps were only applied to certain markets and we happened to be stuck in one of the affected areas. Comcast 'graciously' allowed us to have three months where we could go over the caps per year. We used our three months in 2014 but have yet to receive any credits this year. Our monthly bill should only be approximately $55 per month and sometimes we are paying twice and even three times as much because we are not receiving the waivers that we were promised.
 My wife and I recently made the switch to Comcast business service which is significantly slower and more expensive. Even that process was a hassle. The first sales representative that we spoke with lied about not being able to give us the lowest price that was being advertised. She repeatedly stated that the offer was no longer available in our area. I checked their website two weeks later and the offer was still being advertised. I finally was able to speak with someone that would sell me the least expensive service.
 Now that I no longer have Comcast residential service, I would like to see if it is possible to be reimbursed for the three months that we went over on our data caps.

The person I spoke with at Comcast claims to have fixed my internet through backend systems.
 The Comcast representative proceeded to tell me that I could have 25Mbps more for the same price (75Mbps total) however, it would require a new modem. He processed the order and I hung up. I did receive a UPS tracking number via e-mail the next day to track my package.
 The package arrived today and after I opened it, I discovered that it was a Digital to Analog video set top box and that I had been signed up for new TV service through Xfinity.
 At no time did I ever bring up TV service nor did I authorize this Comcast representative to sign me up for TV. This is a clear cut case of slamming/cramming.
 I just hung up with Comcast customer service and was told that the 75Mbps plan existed and did NOT require a new modem and it was $1 more per month than my old plan.

Without this information, we are at the whim of a supplier who can arbitrarily charge more in fees without any proof or documentation that such fees are justified or warranted.
 Given the state of internet usage in 2015, the data cap imposed (not uniformly across its customers, by the way) is not reflective of the data usage a modern household. The lack of documentation concerning that data usage to allow the consumer to make informed charges that impact him or her financially is also unreasonable and unjustifiable.

During initial installation I told the technician that I had my own modem to use. The technician could not get the modem to ""sync up"" for some unknown reason. He instead installed a Comcast provided modem, for a $9 a month charge. On March 9th I returned the leased Comcast Modem to the Xfinity Store at 3637 Peachtree Rd, Atlanta, GA and installed my personal modem (it synced perfectly). Upon receiving the April bill, it still showed a $9 ""Modem Lease"" charge for the month. I called in and had notified them that I had purchased my own modem. I gave them the identifying information for both the returned modem and my personal modem. June bill showed a credit for 3/9 to 5/1. However, a new ""Modem Rental"" charge appeared for 5/15 to 6/1 for $5.80. I called in to complain, once again stating that I own my modem, and once again was offered a credit. The most recent June bill showed a credit, yet once again for the third time I was incorrectly charged a ""Modem Rental"" fee for 6/19 to 7/1 for $4.33. Upon calling in I was told that I must prove that I did not have a Comcast Modem, and that they don't have any information on the returned or personal modem. However upon logging in the online account management you can clearly see my personally owned Motorola SB6121. This is beyond ridiculous.

 connection. I Pay $50.00 per month just for my internet connection. We have a franchise in this
 small town so I have no other alternative. I have complained for at least 6 months that the speeds
 keep getting wose. I was told my one customer Rep that if I didn't like it to get my service somewhere
 else. Of course, that is not possible because of the franchise agreement the town has with Comcast.

 Yes, they were always calling me when I am at work, when I cannot access my phone and answer
 their questions. This is ridiculous, why canâ€™t they contact me via email or after my work hours. The

 them at that time as I was at work. I asked them to contact me after 6Pm of an evening, but never

338651,Internet Availability,6/13/2015,1:07:20 AM,Internet,Attica,Michigan,48412,Open,No,"For years now, I have lived at my current residence . Attica, Mi, 48412) and have been unable to access the Internet except through satellite internet or through a cell phone signal (mobile data), both of which have incredibly expensive data plans, low data caps (even for the most expensive plans), and are a prime example of the most abhorrent price gouging existing in any industry; now of course even more abhorrent due to the net neutrality being declared. Myself and those in my area have been denied the right to fast, reliable, cheap, and (most importantly) unlimited internet, which has become a necessity in the current day and age for work, movies (of which about 4 or 5 can be viewed each month through great difficulty and then having no data left on any capped plan), video games (with a 6GB cap and most games by themselves being downloaded exceeding that number on their own, not to mention playing games online) and general browsing for news, information, entertainment, etc. The current un-availability of affordable, uncapped, reliable, and reasonably fast internet in my area in unacceptable and is an example of extreme discrimination of those in rural and semi-rural communities. Corrections to this would be well over-due, but now is better than never. Thank you for your time,

369453,"Comcast ""50 mb/s"" speed and throttling",6/26/2015,10:15:55 PM,Internet,Auburn,Georgia,30011,Pending,No,"We recently moved to Georgia, and used to have a great company named charter, but we couldnt get them where we live because Comcast owns all the lines, so we stuck up with Comcast, and when are near our data limit, which if we pass over it we just have to pay for the how much we went over, which is very stupid because we live in 2015, there shouldnt be ANY data caps or limits. When we are at about 75% they start throttling it, hard. Download speeds are super low and we have their 50 mb/s and we almost NEVER actually get 50 mb/s to begin with. It gets VERY hard to accomplish anything online because of this, I use internet quite a lot so seeing their throttling for the past month and a half has been unprofessional because of the high prices for their service, I have tried everything possible on our end, so it has to be on theirs. Enclosed, I have left a screencap of the speeds we get quite often believe it or not, and we are paying for 50 mb/s. Also real quick note, it took 10 minutes to upload this one sceencap. Thank you, and I hope that you can help me and my family out!

359070,Comcast (Xfinity) Monopolistic Billing Practices,6/23/2015,3:49:46 PM,Internet,Auburn,Washington,98092,Closed,No,"I believe Comcast (Xfinity) has been and continues to engage in anti-competitive pricing based SOLELY on the amount of competition that currently exists a given area. I have had Comcast internet service in several locations, most recently in Seattle, WA and Auburn, WA. Recently I logged onto Comcastâ€™s website to see what kind of deals they had going on, and due to Comcast NEVER fixing a glitch in my records where my Seattle, WA address was still (even 2 years and MULTIPLE complaints later) showing up as the default address on my account, even though my Comcast service ONLY goes to my Auburn, WA address I was able to see what deals were available for me to purchase at BOTH addresses. I pay 66.95 a month for 50Mbps (Performance) service in Auburn, WA where there is really no choice in ISPâ€™s (Century Link DSL is not something I consider competition in any sense of the word)â€¦if I wanted to upgrade my service to the â€œBlastâ€ service tier (105Mbps) it would cost me $78.95 a month. If I try to order service for the Seattle, WA address (where there are a number of ISP options) I can get a â€œPerformance Promoâ€ deal that is 105Mbps for $24.99 for 12 months, â€œBlastâ€ tier service (105Mbps) for $29.99 for the first 6 months, or get standard â€œBlastâ€ tier service for $65.95 a month. So basically around 20 minutes away from me I can get service that more than DOUBLES my current speed for LESS than I pay now. In fact living where I do the next lower tier in service is â€œPerformance 25â€ which is 25Mbps service for $61.95â€¦so I can get HALF the service for $5 lessâ€¦nice Comcast.

After multiple attempts to resolve with comcast agents admitting the error, comcast has failed to update their system with the info and continues to persue collections. they have now subbitted to a 2nd collection agency after dropping the issue with the first. This second collection agency has submitted the debt to 1 or more credit reporting bureaus. This has now resulted in a negative impact to our credit and stands as blatant defamation of character as we no longer able to receive loans based on the significant impact this has made to our credit standing.
 This is not the first case of this issue and is just another testament as to how comcast attempts to use their resources to extort its customers for money.

360222,Bandwidth Caps becoming excessive,6/23/2015,9:36:55 PM,Internet,Augusta,Georgia,30907,Solved,No,"I get charged, on average, $50 in overages per month. I feel as though 300Gb is not nearly enough in today's high-bandwidth world. I have noticed an increase since testing Windows 10 at home, as a member of the Microsoft Insider testing group. Each time a new build is released it downloads a DVD worth of data to upgrade the machine to a new build. I am testing it on two machines (desktop and tablet) so effectively I get hit with double the usage each time it happen. On top of that I am a cord-cutter purely because Comcast refuses to release an application for XBox One which is the only device I choose to use for media streaming. Worse, systems like XBox One now employ completed downloaded games instead f physical media so games that are 15Gb or larger can be downloaded frequently. 300Gb simply isn't enough anymore, so if caps are going to continue they need to raise them. Worse, I understand that this cap is only implemented in select areas, so why am I being punished because Comcast wants to test something they aren't even imposing everywhere?
 Mobile Devices + Application Testing + Gaming + Hulu + Netflix + Showtime Anywhere + HBO Go + Amazon Instant Video + Steam
 I don't download torrents or anything. I will be the first to admit that I have done this in the past, but there is so much available now via streaming I have no need to do this. Yet I pay through the nose anyway...
 Someone needs to do something. I am in an area with no alternatives other than Comcast and I feel like I am being punished for using them. As we speak I am working on enabling SNMP on my router, so that I can track my usage using PRTG in order to identify my actual usage compared to what Comcast says I use. I am also engaging WOW (formerly Knology) to see what I can do to get them into my neighborhood.

Well I ask my friends in other areas about their data limits and they have no limit the on their accounts. Now in this day and ago of movie streaming 300 gigs is not a lot to work with. A Netflix movie can be up to 4 gigs not to mention watching hulu and YouTube. This practice is unfair and does nothing to improve the bandwidth in our area since they just charge you more for using more internet. The bandwidth is still throttled when allt of people are on in one area. The data caps in the area are unnecessary and need to go away, seeing they are not in all areas

After signing up online for the promotional rate I was emailed a bill less than a week later at full price. I called customer service and after being sent to billing, then online bills, back to billing than having to call customer solutions to cancel who will only give half the term given online. This would seem to be false advertising for services they don't cover/offer. I have never heard of a major company purposely not honor the online contract that is shown. In the end I was told they can offer me 50 mb for 49.99 for 6 months. I even have a printed copy of the site and what it read. This is unfair because I have now cancelled other services only to find that the contract was false and they don't honor it.

For more than 2 years we had persistent issues of video quality (mostly Skype) being at dial-up quality, even though we were paying for 100mb+ service. All the speed tests passed, which made it suspicious that only one type of traffic wasn't being delivered. After complaining to a national-level VP, they suddenly ""found a setting"" that instantly fixed the problem. It was so very obviously someone got a call from the boss to turn off the throttling. Clearly, these illegal controls are one of their standard practices. We have emails and voicemails to back it up.

279378,Forced Bundling of Internet Service with CATV,5/7/2015,9:16:13 PM,Internet,Ayer,Massachusetts,1432,Open,No,"Comcast (Xfinity) prices their Internet service so that it costs MORE than their Internet & TV bundle,
 forcing/coercing customers to sign up for TV service. This pads the number of Comcast's cable
 subscribers, which I feel is dishonest.
 Further, they force subscribers to take possession of a cheap cable box. If the subscribers return the
 cable box to Comcast, Comcast will cancel the bundle pricing, and the customers' pricing will revert to
 the higher Internet-only price."

 August, including phone, internet, tv and security. Service was good for 4 months until Comcast
 decided to upgrade their systems requiring them to dig from across the street and then burrow to my
 outdated property connection. My service was halted with this construction and never properly
 restored despite numerous calls from me, visits from technicians and promises from customer
 service and management. In the meantime, monthly bills continued to arrive with no
 acknowledgement from Comcast Billing that a problem existed. As you have probably heard before,
 the technical end of their enterprise never seems to communicate with sales. I currently have, after
 several months of no service, an orange cable line on top of my driveway providing no bandwidth. I
 was and still am eager to have their service since we do not move into the remodel for another week.
 I have in recent weeks been in contact with Jerry Biggs, a Kitsap County Operations Manager (253-
 896-5681), and he has been of some help in trying to get the installation reorganized and begun
 again, but my confidence has waned. He like others does not seem able to cut through the seeming
 morass of Comcast and their sub-contractors. Meanwhile I am constantly pestered by Comcast via
 phone and mail to pay my outstanding bill which I will not do. I will resume payments when I have
 service as promised."

 stopped actually using the service in Feb. but paid for the month of March. They continued to bill me
 and I was told, via an online chat session, that the only way that they would accept my termination
 was if I called them. Having no wish to suffer a ""retention"" pitch, I paid for the month of April and sent
 a second written notice, which was also ignored. I even paid for the month of April, although I have
 been with Verizon now since mid-February and haven't used the service since. Now they are calling
 me on the phone and harrassing me for payment. How can they legally refuse to accept a written
 notice of termination?"

348338,Termination Fee,6/18/2015,11:14:49 AM,Internet,Ballston Lake,New York,12019,Solved,No,"On December, 12 2014 I called Comcast to get internet for my business
 in Florida. I spoke with Noel Rivera. I told him I would be moving my
 business at the end of March 2015 so I just needed service for 3 1/2
 months. He told me that would be very expensive, but if I signed a 2
 year contract it would be much cheaper. I told him I did not want to
 sign a contract as I would be moving. He said when I moved I could
 transfer my service to the new location under the same contract. I
 told him where I was moving to was not serviced by Comcast - it was
 serviced by Time Warner. He said Comcast was buying Time Warner so it
 would be no problem to transfer my service. I still did not want to
 sign the contract, but he assured me it would be no problem to
 transfer and I should contact him directly when it was time to do that
 and he would personally handle it. He gave me his direct phone number
 and email address and so I signed a 2 year contract.
 Toward the end of March when it was time to move I emailed and left
 voice mail with Noel multiple time and never received a reply. Then I
 called the main number and spoke with a woman who's name I did not
 get. She said Comcast did not buy Time Warner so I could not transfer
 my service, but since I was moving to an area not serviced by Comcast
 I would not be charged a termination fee. She told me to return my
 equiptment to my local Comcast store and my account would be
 terminated. I did that and moved.
 After a couple of weeks I realized I had never received a final bill,
 so I logged on to the web site, saw I had $220 balance and I paid
 that. It then said I had a $0 balance.
 A few weeks after that I received, on the same day, a bill from
 Comcast for a $1,992.75 termination fee, and a letter from a
 collection agency because that fee had be charged off and sold to
 them.
 I immediately called and spoke with Donte Fisher. I told him all this
 and he said he would have the termination fee removed. He sent me an
 email with his contact info and he said he would call me back that day
 when it was removed. Later that I day I got an email from him saying
 the termination fee would not be removed. I called and left voice mail
 and sent email but he never replied.
 I then called the main number and spoke with a Rhonte Rose. He said if
 I sent him a copy of my businesses' lease in my new location that was
 not serviced by Comcast he would have the termination fee removed. I
 did that and received no reply. Again, multiple emails and voicemails
 were not answered. Called the main number again and I got Carl Nunoo.
 He said Rhonte had rejected my lease because it said ""Sample lease"" on
 the top. I had not noticed this. I contacted my landlord and she said
 she printed the lease off the internet and neglected to remove that.
 She sent me a new lease with ""Sample"" removed. I called the main
 number again and spoke with a woman who's name I did not get. She said
 to send the new lease to Rhonte with that explanation. I did that.
 Once again, multiple emails and voicemails were not answered. I again
 called and I was told that my new lease was also rejected but they did
 not know why. I asked for a supervisor and was told none were
 available. After insisting and insisting they went to get a
 supervisor. I was on hold for 25 minutes and then I was told a
 supervisor would call me that day. Three days later I have not
 received a call back.
 So to summarize, I was coerced into signing a long term contact with
 information that was not true. I was told by 4 Comcast employees that
 I would not be charged a termination fee and I was. I was promised
 callbacks by 4 Comcast employees and I never got them. And now I am
 saddled with a $2000 bill that has been turned over to collections and
 is affecting my credit score.
 Even for Comcast, who is known for horrible customer service, this is
 egregious. I sincerely hope whoever gets this can help me.

241422,Comcast internet/cable,4/17/2015,1:21:20 PM,Internet,Baltimore,Maryland,21224,Closed,No,"To Whom It May Concern:
 I am writing in regards to a bill from Comcast that has been forwarded to collections. I will start at the beginning of my story. I decided I wanted to have Comcast in my home. I called them and set up a time for them to come on 3/20/15 between 9-11 am. After numerous calls to Comcast a gentleman named Nathan came around 2 pm. He was UNABLE to hook up my internet because it was disconnected at the pole. He told me he would come back with a ladder. After numerous phone calls and him not returning I called to cancel the entire service. After a length phone tree, they stated that I would receive no bill as my service was never hooked up and to return the router to the nearest Comcast store which I did the following day. They stated again how I would receive no bill. First I received a bill for $128.69 with billing date of 3/21/15. I called Comcast and the recording stated I had zero balance. I then received a bill for $62.60 with a billing date of 4/7/15. I then called and spoke to a billing representative who stated she would place the request for the refund into her supervisor and it takes 24 hours to process. I called the following day and was informed that there was a still balance so I asked to speak directly with someone who could refund this money. I did and they informed me I would receive a zeroed bill in the mail. I called the following day to confirm that the account had no balance and they informed me that it still did have a balance. I asked to speak to a supervisor who assured me he zeroed my bill. Later that day I got a call from a collections department on behalf of Comcast and the amount of $62.60. I called and spoke with Mia Thompson the head of the billing department at Comcast who stated all she could do was file a ticket with the restitution department who has to call me, but her computer was showing a zero balance. She stated she could not call them as they are not a ""call center"". She stated this process could take 7-14 days. I informed her that I was upset as to how this would affect my credit and she stated that there was nothing more she could do. I went to the Comcast Store in Nottingham MD and they told me the same thing. I am now writing the FCC in regards to this bill that has been forwarded to collections as I do not have confidence that they will communicate with the debt collection agency and that this will remain on my record/credit. I have never come across a company that has business practices so unethical to charge someone for a service that they have NEVER received. I implore that you contact them and mediate this issue on my behalf to ensure that proper communication occurs between Comcast and this debt collection agency and that this does not negatively impact my credit. I also am requesting a written letter once the issue is resolved ensuring me that this debt is not still outstanding with Comcast OR the debt collection agency.
 Thank you,

259003,REPEATED Comcast billing issues,4/27/2015,1:35:21 PM,Internet,Baltimore,Maryland,21239,Closed,No,"Firstly, I had Comcast for about a year and a half in total going on two years in September. I started out with a package costing $79.99 with great channels available. The internet was very slow and it cut off in our area between 1-5 pm everyday for a couple of months last year (this was a major issue but at the time I thought it was just our apartment). A representative came in and fixed everyone's internet connection in the complex.
 As my deal expired, Of course the price went up after our first year and a rep advised me to get the triple play package just so the price would be cheaper. It would then be $99.99/per-month, I NEVER utilized the phone service, don't even know what the devices look like. I did it, and it was good for a while but then as certain prices were added on to the bill after 3 months(It was probably promo channels) that I was unaware of, I decided to discontinue the television services and KEEP the internet services.
 At this time, a representative came and picked up the cable box and had me sign an order to discontinue it and pay off the outstanding bill. All of this is fine. Given that I was paying for the services anyway while the services were temporarily disconnected because that is Comcast policy, I DID NOT COMPLAIN, I complied. As I kept the internet services, Comcast continued to bill me full price for triple play an additional channels which I WAS NOT receiving. As I was calling to rectify the situation I was bounced around and around to different departments and I was on the phone about an hour and a half trying to resolve this situation. NO ONE had a clear cut solution for me. Majority of my wait time on the phone was 20 mins wait for each department I was transferred to so do the math. I was incomplete disgust because I am a working, full-time student that depended on Comcast for this service. For all this, I could have just got a different more affordable internet service provider that would not have caused me all this headache over billing issues and service interruptions. I mainly disappointed with their ability to rectify the situation once I speak to a representative. Today, Monday April 27, 2015 would be third time I am calling COMCAST to rectify the same situation that I thought I fixed 3 hours and two calls ago.
 THIS IS REALLY RIDICULOUS. AT THIS POINT I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SERVICE TO ANY OTHER FULL TIME STUDENTS THAT I KNOW. The ability to work things out once is unheard of here.

 I've been a Comcast customer for a couple years. Recently, I had forgotten what Internet speeds I'm paying for and I checked my bill and my online customer profile for this information. It was not there. It took me nearly 20 minutes dealing with a customer service rep online to learn my upload and download speeds.
 This is unacceptable. I did some research and contacted Comcast. They told me via Twitter and online chat that they only list the name of the Internet plan on customers' bills, but not the speeds they're paying for.
 This lack of disclosure is an undue hardship on a customer's right to fully understand the services they are paying for, and to easily compare Internet speeds and prices among providers in our area.
 Comcast will make all sorts of excuses about why this disclosure to the customer is not made. But they are excuses and do not address the ongoing damage and harm that the company is perpetrating on their customers' right to easily access vital information about their account.

 1. they do not disclose what Internet speed on the bill on our online account
 2. with cable tv, they give you a free offer for a specified period of time (6 month for example) and then start charging you for it after the free offer has expired
 3. billing - they say that if we drop home phone (we have triple plan bundle) our bill will go up, not down
 4. they have an exclusive contract with Baltimore City so we have no other choice since FIOS is not available in the city.

 Comcast got in touch with me by phone and email. They were willing to allow us to discontinue the triple play and lower the rates (rather than what they have always said, which is that the rates go up). We cancelled our phone and are saving about $50/month for a year.
 However, the model they use is not fair to the consumer, or sustainable in the long run. I do not want to pay for stations that I don't watch (for example all the sports stations) even though Comcast has to pay for them. We need an alternative to the monopoly that Comcast has in Baltimore, thanks to our short-sighted local government.
 Thanks for your assistance.

This happens at all hours of the day and when the service is ""working"" the quality of the stream is extremely poor. I am not downloading anything or watching streaming services on multiple devices, its' ONE device running in the entire apartment. The device is located within feet of the router, so I know it's not a range issue. These issues have occurred constantly since I signed up for service in January 2015.

360378,Paying for high speed internet with Comcast. Consistently getting slow service.,6/23/2015,10:37:16 PM,Internet,Baltimore,Maryland,21202,Open,No,"I am paying for high speed internet (27mbps or so) with Comcast yet I am consistently getting cut outs almost a couple times a week and slow downs where it consistently speedtests between 10-17 mbps. In fact my speed rarely peaks above 22mbps. My service has cut in and out and i still receive calls either direct from comcast or their third party representatives urging me to add additional services such as tv or phone even though i dont have a TV or a land line. When I have called for service, the wait has been days and on occasion during the diagnostic of a slow down, my service will shut down entirely. I have been told repeatedly that it is because I am not using a comcast modem and I should rent one from them and they will guarantee that it works for a monthly rental fee which would far surpass the cost of buying one outright. I'm just generally displeased and have been over my year and a half of service with them. If I am consistently only getting half the speed I am paying for, I should be paying half the price.

When I initially signed up I was ""forced"" into taking a package of cable and internet despite only wanting internet--the force was created by ridiculous package offerings where it actually costs more to receive less service. In my case, it originally cost $89 for cable and internet but would cost $99 for only internet. Now, after a year of that 'promotional price,' I am being charged $110 for the same exact service with no options to downgrade service to a lower rate per month. These monopolistic behaviors are in no way beneficial to customers.

MOnty in the changes department said he would not waste his manager's time or mine by even calli them to the phone and refused to let a supervisor assist with the call. He said that I needed to pay my bill and that noboby on earth could lift the hold on my delinquent account. Mind you; I just paid the bill. This company has shown false advertising in packages and when you try to downgrade they hit you with hidden fees and unexplained charges then disconnect your service when you try to get the issue resolved.

We have had this service for over a year now and we do not need it. I have called several times speaking to people who work for comcast stating that we are not in a contract and yet for the past months we have charged 29.99 for service we do not even use. I told them over the phone that we are paying for something that we do not need and yet our bill continuing being over 600 a month. I am always getting a disconnet note without them even calling me. They want their payment on time but yet they do not want to even work with you. The home security people are rude especially Ms. Angie and the supervisor who worked on June 9. No one wants to be accountable for their action and they just pass the phone to different department. I am very upset because I have trying to get rid of this home security of the longest and yet I do not use it. It has been over a year and now Xfinity is saying I am in a 3 year contract with them. I did not sign for a 3 year contract and I told them there was fraud committed. I do not want this account any more and I have told them this specifically that it is fraud and I do have a police report. I want this account to be removed because I am paying for someone else.

294386,Week long issues with speed and no help from comcast,5/18/2015,9:36:31 AM,Internet,Bartonville,Illinois,61607,Solved,No,"I initially called Comcast on Tuesday May 12 about my speed issues. Did some troubleshooting,
 checked signal levels, determined a tech visit was needed. Scheduled a visit for Saturday May 16
 between 8 AM and 10AM (nothing sooner was available). Come Friday afternoon, May 15, I called to
 VERIFY the appointment. I was informed no appointment existed. I got upset but remained calm and
 insisted a tech appointment be scheduled for Saturday May 16, I was told that he would put a request
 in and dispatch would call me in 2 hours. 3 hours later, still no phone call. I called back and insisted
 on speaking to a supervisor. Was told that none were available, but he can help. He told me he put
 an emergency request in, and provided me a ticket number (a CR number) and he promised he
 would call back in 10-20 minutes. An hour later...still no phone call. I called back and was very
 frustrated at this point. Once again, I requested a supervisor but none were available. He stated he
 put an emergency request in for me, provided me a ticket number (an ER number), and someone
 from dispatch will call me first thing in the morning. 9:45AM on May 16 comes and I finally get a call
 from dispatch. The person told me there is NOTHING available that day or sunday and that Monday
 is the earliest available slot. Explained my situation, and I got told ""Its either Monday or never, deal
 with it!"" And was then hung up on. I immediately called into customer service. and spoke to another
 rep. She says she can get me an appointment from 3-5pm that day (May 16th) and she promised me
 this. She placed me on hold and came back stating she was unable to get this appointment but will
 have someone from dispatch call me back. I refused the call back as after being told few times I'd get
 calls, and never called back I was leery of trusting yet another rep. I insisted on a supervisor at that
 point. She placed me on hold and came back and said no supervisors were available. I again,
 demanded a supervisor. She said she will have one call me back. I refused and again demanded a
 supervisor. She states that they're busy right now. I told her that was fine and I would wait. She
 placed me on hold and 15 minutes later a supervisor picked up. He promised to get a tech out by
 3PM that day (May 16th), and I would get a call by 1PM from dispatch to confirm the appointment. As
 of 2:00PM that day I never received a phone call. So I went outside and opened the comcast box and
 found the cable connections were very loose. After I tightened the connections, my issues are
 resolved. This complaint is for the lack of customer service I received. I should not have to climb on
 the side of my house to correct an issue a tech should have done. My only option for high speed
 internet is comcast. I do not consider AT&T's 6mbps DSL as ""high-speed""."

360806,Comcasts Shady Business Practices,6/24/2015,3:43:45 AM,Internet,Battle Ground,Washington,98604,Open,Yes,"My only available broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television from my service package. I pay Strictly for the Internet Package anyways. Yet for some reason i am charged a TV Franchise Fee every single month. The bill Also has been increasing steadily. It went from being an extra 10$ a month for the extra speed, to 12$, with absolutely zero notice anywhere. Not even an email stating the price increase in the email Comcast gave me.
 Sadly the only other Internet choice out here we have is Century Link, Which is not a Broadband service. I would readily switch providers if i had a choice. Not only is their business practices shady, they have some of the worst customer service i have ever had.

 Comcast Cable Issues:
 1. We live in a resort town when population increases or during peak user times morning and evening, internet service gets slow and is spotty.
 2. Constant outages with no notification.
 3. When you call with a problem they expect you to work along with them to diagnose sometimes taking hours of your time to fix their equipment or service problem.
 4. If problem can't be fixed they charge you to send a technician $50.00 and call it an installation fee. I rent this equipment $10.00 fee for a modem. $2.99 fee for each digital adapter per month.
 5. They arbitrarily raise your bill without notification. Bills are impossible to comprehend.
 6. Service techs say they only get paid 15 minutes per call after 15 minutes, I had one tell me he couldn't fix it in that time frame, so he left and told me to call again.
 7. They quote you prices on the phone but when you get your bill, its more money.
 Thank you.

 but I get charged $169.95 from an outside company for a 1 year warranty on my products.
 I see this as very unprofessional, and very wrong of Comcast to do. Telling a customer that you are
 transferring them to someone only to be transferred to someone else and scammed out of money is
 absolutely horrid."

 for them to look at our property and if they would they would see it would be profitable due to the
 hundreds of houses that are in my neighborhood. I like to play video games, my son likes watching
 youtube and my wife loves browsing and watching Netflix and hulu. The caps the satellite people offer
 are ridiculous because we could use that in a day! Gaming for me is the only way I can stay social

 payment date. I was told this twice By two different people. Called billing back today and was told that
 since the arrangement is with a bank they can't change it and there was nothing they could do. I was
 lied to twice and then lied to again because I was not made aware of the disclaimer or read that

I called Comcast twice and they confirmed the fee. But when I got a bill it was.... $100.54 per month fee. I called Comcast and was explained that ...it is legitimate fee that includes $50 hidden fee they did not say to me about while I signed up. No way to get the fee reasonable - I paid $30 per month for the Internet all time before, and here for very slow, very frequently non-working service - $100 per month - that unbelievable, Comcast lied from the first moment I contacted it with service request. Even they promised $20 for not arriving on time to arrange the connection - Comcast ""forgot"" about the promise. I very skeptical that government is able to support affordable and competitive Internet service in the country, even if in 70 miles from the National Capital Comcast can commit such fraud without any remorse and apologies. $100 per month for slow and not reliable Internet it is not what US citizen deserved supporting FCC for their taxes.

 2. Around the middle of the week of June 3, TTB IT received numerous calls that the phones could no longer connect. In the course of TTB IT troubleshooting it was found that the issue was only TTB employees with Comcast as their Internet Service provider. Users with all other Internet service providers do not have the issue â€“ their phones continue to connect without issue.
 3. On further troubleshooting it was discovered that Comcast is intermittently blocking UDP port 443 and this is causing the VOIP phone to fail to connect.
 4. Users with an ISP other than Comcast see the following on a TTB broadband test

 Please close out this Complaint as being successfully resolved.
 Background shared by our IT operations on Problem Resolution:
 Last evening our IT Department was contacted by a number of Comcast personnel, including some superb network engineers. Interestingly enough, I believe the Comcast contact resulted from a TTB employee passing the information in the broadcast to someone they know who works for Comcast. That Comcast person escalated this issue to the correct people and that was the key to this problem being resolved. This is the second day running where a non-IT TTB employee took action that resulted in a problem resolution breakthrough. My thanks for your involvement and willingness to help!!
 This turned out to be an exceptionally complex issue. The Internet is really a series of interconnected networks, all run by different providers. For the TTB employees with the issue, their Internet traffic went from Comcast to at least 2 other providers before it got to TTB. The issue was actually UDP Port 443 (donâ€™t worry what that is) being intermittently blocked/lost/whatever. This block happened not at Comcast but at one of the provider networks between Comcast and TTB. After we worked with Comcast for several hours, they dropped us off the call and went to work with the other providers and worked until the issue was resolved on our behalf. It was exceptional support by Comcast!

 Just a recap on Problem Resolution: Thanks again. (b) (6)
 1. Comcast support engineers contacted TTB OCIO personnel on the evening of June 8, 2015. Those personnel worked through the evening troubleshooting the problem. They followed up with us this morning to make sure the problem is resolved.
 2. Comcast determined that they were not blocking UDP port 443 either intentionally or due to a problem in their network.
 3. Comcast engineers traced the issue to another network between Comcast and TTB and worked with those providers to correct the issues.
 4. The Comcast support personnel that worked with TTB individuals and told you that UDP port 443 was not blocked by Comcast were in fact correct. A lot (not all) of the UDP port 443 traffic was blocked by another provider in the path between Comcast and TTB, but not by Comcast.
 5. Because the issue was outside of the Comcast network this was a difficult issue that could only be resolved with the level of support we received from Comcast last night. The Comcast engineers worked with the provider that had the issue and their efforts led to the problem being solved.
 6. The problem is resolved.

So in feb on the 14th I cancelled the home security and in march got an early termination fee 600 dollars worth. So I call on March 16th stating what happened and requested them to pull the phone call. A week and a half later I call to see why there has been no progress they state that you have to call the call center the rep was at to have the phone call pulled (nice to know now). So they file an escalation ticket and I am all like okay on April 7th I call and the rep states he makes a note to have them call me ASAP. It is April 15th I have called they said they can do nothing except stating that I was in a contract and they told me this phone call that you have 60 days to turn it back on (even thiugh on march 16th she said it was 30 days and I was 2 days passed that deadline) and I almost agreed to turn it back on and pay the stupid 40 dollars a month. Except, I was told I was not in a contract and for a month no one bothered to call me back like they were supposed to. I have been a loyal customer to comcast for 4 years but next month I will pay them the dumb fee and then find a new provider as they are a bunch of lieing, cheating, money stealing, people.

Checked credit card statement-still shows double billing. Called this morning 4/9/15 at about 8:40am, still not fixed. He put me on hold, I hung up after 8 minutes. He never called back. He is what I'm going to do-no more on-line payment-I'll use checks, no more paperless billing, which only benefits Comcast. Comcast, don't waste any more of my time by calling and apologizing, it's another time waster. Unfortunately Comcast is the only game in town.

216441,download speeds slower than dial-up but paying for 25 Mbps,4/3/2015,1:41:50 PM,Internet,Bellevue,Washington,98006,Closed,No,"I have contacted Comcast multiple times regarding internet speeds between 1-2 Mbps. The service I am paying for is 25 Mbps. Comcast has sent out a technician multiple times. The technical has re-wired connections multiple times and has fixed either the boot record of the Comcast modem or the Comcast modem firmware. The fix will last about 1-2 week and the slow internet connection returns. Comcast is in violation of the terms and conditions that I have signed up for the service. Falsely advertising internet speeds and not delivering service as agreed to.

 FCC team:
 Thank you for reaching out to Comcast Cable regarding continue Internet issues. I would like to add to the complaint that I have been invoiced $36 for the service call. According to Comcast policies, if the trouble shooting call is not related to in-house wiring nor the owners equipment, there is no charge for the service call. In this instance, the issue was related to an incorrectly configured Boot File. The Boot File to the modem is managed, maintained, configured and pushed out by Comcast systems. There should be no charge for the service call.
 I just finished talking to Bob at Comcast Billing and he refused to issue a credit for the service call.
 Who do I need to work with to eliminate the overcharges?
 Thanks, (b)

 Comcast has been charging us twice every month with equipment rentals, a claimed $10/Wireless Gateway fee and a $10/modem rental fee, even though we only have 1 modem. This makes me wonder if we are being charged incorrectly or the bills mis-printed. The account is udner the name of my father and I am wondering how I or the FCC could take action on this.

367375,Comcast Internet Technical Support,6/26/2015,4:54:18 AM,Internet,Bellingham,Washington,98225,Solved,No,"On 6/26/2015, Friday, between 12:45 am and 1:30 am PDT, I attempted to contact Comcast Technical Support at (800)934-6489 six times. First time I called, they answered then they hung up on me. Second time thru the sixth time, they didn't say anything. They just hung up the phone. I don't know what type of game those foreign assholes are playing but it isn't funny. Those foreign assholes have no consideration towards the customers. What is it going to take for Comcast to do something about those foreign assholes who are taking away job from Americans? A multimillion dollar law suit? Those foreign assholes that comcast has employed treat me like dirt. If I were comcast, I would fire the lot of them and give those jobs to red blooded Americans. I don't appreciate going into a call center 10,000 miles away in a foreign country. I am an American and when I call Comcast, I want to deal with an American only and not some ignorant foreigner that is located 10,000 miles away in some damn foreign country. If it weren't the fact that Comcast has a monopoly here, I would switch to another cable company. Comcast SUCKS!!!

231265,Residentail Broadband Data Caps,4/12/2015,3:10:25 PM,Internet,Belmont,Michigan,49306,Closed,No,"I am writing to inform you of my complete opposition to the data caps that Comcast intends to roll out for most if not all of its broadband subscribers. These caps are clearly a way for Comcast to increase revenue and having nothing to do with network congestion. Source: http://customer.comcast.com/help-and-support/internet/data-usage-trials-what-are-the-different-plans-launching
 I do not understand how they can charge me for both the speed of my connection and how much I use it. If they are charging me based on speed, I should reasonably expect that speed to be available for use most of the time. If they are charging based on consumption, then why limit speed. It seems to be a catch-22.
 My family utilizes our internet greatly in our daily lives. We stream music through publically available apps, do a good amount of gaming and stream most of our media through apps like Netflix, Hulu, etc. We also regularly backup our computers through the cloud, for security purposes. Despite this basic level of usage, we are still above Comcast's projected cap of 350GB on a monthly basis. This is with managing our network intelligently by limiting the quality of the streams we watch and turning off apps and services when not in use. Even Comcast's data estimation tool projects we will be well over the cap.
 The crux of my complaint is that they are able to do this because they do not have the fear of competition in the marketplace. Per the recent FCC decision defining broadband as 25mbs or greater, they are one of only 2 operators in our area that can offer that speed. If both of these operators decide to cap residential data (as they both want to), it creates a duopoly in the local market . This is not the best and highest use of our nation's broadband infrastructure, much of which is subsudized by public money.
 Please do everything you can do ensure this policy is not implemented, or the rest of the country will experience the disasters that have occurred in the communities where they have tested these data caps.

I'm a current Comcast client and I had contacted Comcast before I built and they told me no issue on getting connected at my new location. Now they are saying they have no plans to connect me. They have used several excuses none of which are real. Their first excuse was they didn't have cable run to this area yet. I explained to them that wasn't true and gave them the address of the homes that are connected. The last one was they can't cross other peoples property to get to mine. There are utility easements on both sides of the road so there is no such issue. The neighbor right next to me has been trying to get connected as well. Another one further away in the subdivision was told they would connect him for $10000.00. That is stealing and I can't believe they told him that. They should be fined for suggesting they be paid such a crazy amount for them to provide a service which they are in the business of providing. There are no other choices here in Raymore for cable my understanding is Comcast is the only cable provider. They have this market, but yet won't provide the service. I was finally told I had to talk to their construction department which I have left messages multiple times and they say they will call you back within 24 hours and it has been weeks and no call back. They are terrible and if I had another choice I wouldn't even be trying to get their service but since they are the only one that can provide service in Raymore I have no other choice. Your help in this matter would be greatly appreciated. I can be reached at

 provided the service I've come to expect from them. On top of the never ending problems when you
 finally get through to them you connected to a representative who english is sub par therefore a
 language and comprehension barrier occurs. They never fix your problem even though they say they
 have fixed it so you have to call back again to actually get the problem fixed the following month. I call
 to pay my bill and ask them the amount (which is never the same as whats posted online) and when I
 pay that amount I get a notice the next month because I was short $10 its so frustrating. They never
 connect you to a manager when you ask them to. It becomes very frustrating when all you want to do

232450,Billing problem,4/13/2015,2:26:56 PM,Internet,Berkeley Lake,Georgia,30096,Closed,No,"I have searched the Internet looking for a local Comcast number, or corporate number to call concerning the billing problem I am writing about, but have found nothing.
 This complaint revolves around unresolved Comcast Cable Billing, per the attached bill. Iâ€™m told by Comcast, this bill does not appear on my account and therefore they canâ€™t view it. In other words they donâ€™t know anything about how I got this bill. The attached bill reflects credits of $110 from Comcast ($212.55 less $110 in credit, leaving a balance of $102.55). The $102.55 was paid on time to Comcast. Since they cannot find this bill their position is that I owe for the total of $212.55 plus my normal bill amount. This is the essence of my complaint although there are service related charges detailed below.
 The telephone and internet component of my service has been going on and off for the last several months (sometimes several times per hour). Comcast has made repeated service calls (approximately 9 visits) replacing the modem, cables inside and out, splitters, ground wire etc. They also drilled a new hole in the outside of the house to ease the running of an interior replacement cable. After each visit, the telephone and internet service worked for a short period and then returned to the on/off cycle. After the last visit, an inside cable was replaced but he system still did not work and the technician said that sometimes just plugging the modem into another wall outlet would solve a problem. He did and the internet and telephone have worked since (I would think that would have been tried on the first visit).
 To Comcastâ€™s credit they gave a series of credits on my last bills but still charged for replacing wiring inside the house (which did not solve the problem). The billing person I spoke to today, April 13, said she would submit a request for the wiring to be removed from the bill. However, I doubt this since, on April 5th I spent nearly 1 Â½ hours on the phone trying to straighten out the bill. That person agreed that my bill should be adjusted and it would be updated within 24 hours. However nothing has been changed on the current bill.
 I have found the customer service people and technicians to be nice but typically, when reporting a service problem or trying to resolve a billing problem I am talking to someone in a far away land with less than good English and poor listening skills. To end, the Internet and telephone problem should have been resolved on the first visit i.e. plugging the modem into a different outlet. I have spent many, many hours talking to the billing department and being at home with the Technicians while they did hours of unnecessary work.
 Hopefully the FCC can intervene and help me resolve this billing problem.
 Thank you for your attention.

373879,Service refusal and lower than advertised speeds.,6/30/2015,12:40:28 AM,Internet,Berkeley Spring,West Virginia,25411,Open,No,"I tried to get Comcast cable internet at my home. The home is near other homes which are receiving cable internet services. Comcast has avoided providing me with internet services for years. The company has offered excuses about service area and the type of telephone poles around my house in what I believe is an effort to avoid incurring the expense of providing me cable internet. Internet with reasonable speed has become akin to telephone as a utility. The only company in the area that will service me is Frontier Telecom. Frontier hasn't given me any difficulties as a customer, but in their advertising in the area they promise speeds of 6 MegaBytes per second. The plan I pay for states I could get 6 MegaBytes download speed. I currently only receive about 1.5 MegaBythes of download speed. The telecom companies in my rural area are abusing their customers and potential customers because of their oligopoly. Is there anything you can do to either force Comcast to meet my reasonable request to service the property, or compel Frontier to provide me with the speeds they promise in their advertising?

347973,COMCAST - MAJOR COMPLAINT 1ST TIME CUSTOMER - AGGRAVATED HEALTH ISSUES,6/18/2015,9:37:51 AM,Internet,Berwyn,Pennsylvania,19312,Closed,No,"Scheduled Comcast installation (bundle, phone internet, tv) for May 28th 3 wks prior. I called May 27 to confirm install & they said it was cancelled. That started my BP going in wrong direction! I called my comcast rep & he said he would try and get install asap for next day. That took several texts & phone calls! He even told me to call his supervisor & I placed several calls to him also. Tech came out on 29th and did half install, I was not happy. They had to come out a 2nd time. I have made over 50 calls to comcast since complaining that I will not pay my first month bill until I get some satisfaction. All they did was waive the install fee. My BP has been raised in the last 3 wks going through over 50 calls to get satisfaction for the pain & suffering they put me through. I should not have to call that many times to get what I deserve. I also called to speak to a director at a higher level & they put in a ticket #ESL01957453 on June 16. No call back yet. I am so frustrated with comcast to the point I wish I could get a different carrier, but I just moved to senior housing (after being on the wait list for almost 3 yrs) and had to move the end of May 2015. I had FIOS prior for years & they never put me through this ever in over 15 yrs. My first comcast bill is due Monday, June 22 & I have told them (at least 10 people) over the calls that I am not paying one dime til I get satisfaction. I am asking for the first month bill to be waived due to pain & suffering of what they put me through with no call backs. I always pay my bills and will pay comcast going forward, but not until I get the 2nd bill from them. If they threaten to cancel me, there will be justice! ALL I WANT IS MY FIRST BILL WAIVED AND I WILL BE A SILENT COMCAST CUSTOMER GOING FORWARD! If this does not get resolved in my favor, that first month bill balance can stay on forever, because it's not going to be paid ever! I hope you understand, I am 63 and don't need this as a first time customer. Someone dropped the ball and cancelled my install and I wish I knew who it was so I can get them fired!!!!! IT WAS NOT ME...ALL I DID WAS CALL TO CONFIRM MY INSTALL DATE WHEN THEY DROPPED THE BALL ON ME :(
 I AM ONLY ASKING TO WAIVE THE FIRST MONTH BILL. THE INSTALL FEE IS NOT ENOUGH FOR WHAT I WENT THROUGH, SEVERAL PHONE CALLS, TEXTS, AGGRAVATION, DISAPPOINTMENT, STRESS, THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE LITTLE PEOPLE!!!

 Thanks for your email, I greatly appreciate it.
 As I said, I am NOT PAYING MY FIRST BILL for Comcast!!!
 They have been resistant to my calls and pleas!
 All they did was take off the install fee!!
 This has affected me mentally and physically due to my heart condition.
 Who waits til the day before to CANCEL MY SERVICE?
 May I ask why they won't be calling me instead of a mail response?
 Also I thought I made a copy of my complaint to you....is it possible to get a copy of my letter??

353984,Connecting the service,6/20/2015,3:28:21 PM,Internet,Bethesda,Maryland,20817,Solved,No,"I went to Comcast service centre at 50 west guide dr suite 60, Rockville , MD on Thursday June 11, 2015 to subscribe to Internet and TV services as a new customer, and they let me pay $ 77.98 as a one month advance deposit.
 I tried to connect the service by myself as they recommend but it was useless. I called the technical support and they told me they will send someone on Monday, June 15, 2015 from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. I stayed as home waiting for the technician, and at 4:44 pm a got a call from them to tell me the technician will be late and he will come maximum by 7:00 pm, so I agreed on that as I had no choice and I waited but nobody was showed up. I called and be surprised by an automated response telling me that my appoint rescheduled to Wednesday June 17, 2015 without any notes. After that the appointment rescheduled to Sunday June 21, 2015 after a long call with the customer service to complain. Unfortunately , I got a phone call today Saturday June 20, 2015 and they want to reschedule my appointment again which was a shock to me as I never expected that to happen after all my calks and complains with their customer services. To add to all of that, I received an email from Comcast on June 16, 2015 sending me a bil of $ 107.71 due on July 6, 2015 and I have not even activated their seri ice till now.
 Because of that some friends advised me to file a complain with you as you can protect the customer from such issues.
 P.S
 I tried to solve that with them but I couldn't and I tried to reach a higher level in customer service to speak about that but I couldn't reach anyone. In general it is difficult to reach them.
 Thank you and I do seek your help because I feel they screw me up.

348310,Over Charge by lying,6/18/2015,11:08:53 AM,Internet,Blacksburg,Virginia,24060,Solved,No,"Dear Sir or Madam,
 I opened Comcast's Xfinity service by calling them about two month ago. An agent told me the price was $54.99 a month and she could help me open the account. I agreed. However, they charged me $64.99 a month. I called them twice about this issue in the past two weeks. The first agent told me they would call me back. However, they never did. The second agent basically hung off the phone after I told her what happened. I think at least their agents are not honest. I felt a kind of being robbed and fooled. $10 is not a big deal. However, I do not want to be fooled in such a way. So I decided to file a complaint. I am wondering if you can help me make them set the price to the right one. In this way, I also think we can make Comcast a better company.

300985,Comcast keeps changing bill and every time gives new reasons!!,5/21/2015,11:29:53 AM,Internet,Blackwood,New Jersey,8012,Solved,No,"I've been a customer with Comcast for over 6+ years and my only complain is that anytime I've done
 any upgrades or downgrades, I've been on the phone with them for hours, days and weeks
 sometimes because of the billing issue. The amount I get charged is always more and I never get the
 same information from the agents - at times, agents refuse to give their ID number and even hang up
 the phone, knowing that the conversation is going to go nowhere.
 I've attached my previous bills (October 2014-May 2015) and initially was paying an amount of
 $29.99; but in January 2015 I got an upgrade and was specifically told that it would be a $12.00
 increase in addition to the $29.99, which should add up to $41.99 (with the taxes) and that price
 would be good for a year (January 2016). The month of April my bill was $45.15 - no reason given, I
 paid it. And not for the month of May it's $56.99. That's a $15.00 increase from $41.99 - without any
 apparent reason. I called Comcast and after almost 45 mins to an hour of hold and being transferred
 I'm told that my promotional rate is over. How is it over if I just got the promotion in January 2015?
 I've attached the older bills and have previous bills as well (before October) if needed. I would highly
 appreciate it if someone could please look into this matter. I'm a full time student and I've to keep my
 spending at a budget. I do not have cable TV, phone service; just internet because I need to get my
 school work done from home, but with these fluctuating bills without any reason is really not
 acceptable. Last individual I spoke to, her name was Fey (no agent gives out last name) and ID # 2J4
 I await your response earnestly and thank you for your time and consideration into this matter."

347021,COMPLAINT AGAINST COMCAST,6/17/2015,6:54:21 PM,Internet,Bloomfield,Michigan,48302,Open,No,"June 17, 2015
 RE: COMCAST CABLE TV AND INTERNET SERVICE
 This is
 MI 48382
 3 phone calls and 4 online chats (by me) at least 6 phone calls, including hang ups, by my renters and nearly 10 hours of my time alone on the phone in the past few weeks and they have again screwed up and cut off the service at my rental property.
 We finally figured out that someone at Comcast signed me up for online billing and so I wasnâ€™t receiving bills. When bills werenâ€™t paid they cut off service. No one could find where I signed up and different people said I was and wasnâ€™t signed up. Twice now I was told to pay the minimum immediately (which I did) and they would reinstate service and mail copies of the bills to me. And, not to worry no more was due until end of June..
 Then TV was restored but not internet. That required another 3 hours on the phone and a service call.
 Now service is cut off again. Renters called and were told it was shut off for nonpayment. I still have received no bills (inluding the past due ones that they twice said they would mail to me).
 Neither me nor my renters have any more patience left with these people. Every call is at least 2 +hours and no one understands English or the problem. Talking with a supervisor is out of the question. I was told last week, one would call me right back. After an hour, I called and they said to be patient. I waited by the phone for another 2 hours and never did receive a call. So, I had to start all over again.
 Today, I asked for a supervisor 3 times in the first 10 minutes and after 30 minutes, when I finally said I will not speak to you any longer, I want a supervisor or I will contact the FCC, they cut me off.
 This is outrageous treatment of customers. Everyone knows that Comcast is the most hated company in America but why are they allowed to do this to us?
 If I have the opportunity, I will also talk about how they give these â€œspecialsâ€ that all expire at different times so that your bill is always different and you have to call in and go through a couple hours of negotiating to get it resolved. And, then, it can only be adjusted going forward, so the changes they make to your account have to be paid, even though you havenâ€™t approved of them.
 My renter has a heart condition and is continually being stressed by them. I get so stressed I get sick over it. Iâ€™m a senior widow and I canâ€™t do this all the time.
 What can you do to help me? I donâ€™t mind paying bills but I need a bill to see what I am paying. I have always paid what they want when I call in and begged and been promised that bills would come in the mail so I could pay everything owed. How can they not send me bills and yet charge me late fees and cut off service and charge reinstatement fees? I havenâ€™t had a bill since March and have made 2 credit card payments to them on the phone for reinstating. (b) (6)
 This is such an abuse of power and is so wrong.
 Thanks for whatever help you can give me.

 Since I filed the complaint on 6-18, I had a phone call from Comast on 6-19 from - Judy K., Executive Customer Relations, Comcast l Corporate, Office: (734) 254-1696
 she wanted to resolve the issue. I told her she was premature because I still had not received any bills to pay and credits had not been discussed with me. She said she would review my file and talk with me later. Then I received an e-mail from her with the same information. (Note, she said she would review my file but obviously hadn't prior to contacting me.)
 Fast forward to yesterday. and my renters (at the service location) received a call that ""their"" (my) account was overdue and service would be cut off. There is no reason for them to be calling my renters! Today, June 24, I received a notice in the mail, dated June 19, 2015 (a week ago!) indicating that I must pay $286.35 by June 28 (Sunday) or all service would be discontinued and I would incur reactivation fees etc. ! I have no idea what the $286.35 represents. I have asked for bills since March and have received none. In my numerous discussions with Comcast, I have requested copies of the bills so I could pay them - and - 3 times, told that they would be mailed to me - NOTHING! . I have asked for them to be faxed but told they cannot do that. On 5/30, I received a similar notice, dated a week before and with 2 days (June 1) to pay or be cut off .
 How did they let this notice even get to me? Why didn't this Judy actually read my file and figure out that I need bills to pay and do something about it! I don't know why I'm not getting bills but after so many weeks of this and hours of phone contact with them now pushing up into about 12, I am sick with stress!!!!!
 Fine these people!!!

 Please first re-read history below.
 I received the ""closing"" letter from Comcast yesterday. It is so wrong on so many levels! The letter accuses me of signing up for ""online billing"" and then not paying my bill. And, that they magnanimously provided credits to me for some late fees and reactivation fees!
 The issue here is that, since March, I have not received any bills! Each time I called to find out what is going on and to get a bill I was merely told what to pay and paid it. Numerous times I was told, (b) (6)
 (b) (6)
 (b) (6)
 including by Judy K, the Comcast agent handling this complaint, that I WAS NOT SIGNED UP FOR ONLINE BILLING and should be getting bills in the mail! And just as many times I was told that I WAS SIGNED UP which made more sense because I was not receiving bills. With no bills to pay, my service was cut off twice. Add to that, then there was a technical problem and when they came out to repair, they tied the booster into a LIGHT SWITCH!!!, so that when they left and turned the light out, the service went out again. This prompted another service call which I understand I have been charged for. I do not have the July bill, despite Judy telling me that I would receive it by July 15. This is what happens every month. When I think I have this
 straightened out, I am promised a bill and never get one and then they cut off my service for not paying.
 I asked many times who signed me up for online billing because I would never do this and would not know how to use it and was never given an answer. I am a senior widow and these inconsiderate people are tormenting me. I have spent upwards of 15 hours trying to resolve this with them. I have been given the runaround and blamed for not paying all with their condescending attitude and basic rudeness. Now, in their closing letter, they admit that I was signed up for online billing in April and that they finally took me off of it in June. (Note that they didn't say who signed me up!) Once again, if they actually had taken me off online, I think I would have received a current bill in the mail and I have not!
 When reading off some of the charges on the bills I hadn't received, I was told that there was a charge for a movie. I told the agent Judy that I had asked everyone who could have possibly done that and everyone said that they did not rent that movie. Judy said that she would reverse the charge if I put a movie block on the service and when I said I didn't want to do that, she said ""well then I won't reverse the charge"".
 I asked the agent, Judy K, who was supposed to be settling this, what she was going to do to keep me as a customer and she replied ..... ""well, I am going to mail a copy of the old bills to you and be sure that you get bills in the future and I see that some charges have been reversed"". Really? Again in a condescending tone and with total arrogance! What about all the other service charges, late charges and credit when we did not have service!
 Despite what the letter says, THEY HAVE NOT APOLOGIZED TO ME.
 Since I don't have the July bill I was supposed to receive, I have no idea what the new charges presumably are for service tech, reinstatement and late fees again. And, even though I made a phone payment the other days for $100 just to make sure I didn't get cut off again, I have no idea where I stand with charges and all the payments they have taken from me over the phone since March.
 This is so unacceptable and such an abuse of power.
 If you, the FCC, cannot fine them, demand an acknowledgement of their errors and full resolution, I guess legal action would be my only recourse. And, that is not something I want to do.
 How do they manage to operate this way? The power of monopoly maybe??
 Thank you,

 Saturday 6/27
 Judy,
 This is exactly where I
 expected this to be.
 On 6/23, my renters
 got a recorded call saying that their
 service would be cut off for non-payment (there is no
 reason
 to be contacting my renters! I
 gave that phone number for
 serviceman to
 call prior to arrival). (b) (6)

 On 6/24, I received
 a FINAL NOTICE BEFORE SUSPENSION AND
 TERMINATION OF XFINITY SERVICES in the mail. It was date
 a
 week prior 6/19 and gave me 2 business
 days to pay
 $286.35. I have no idea what
 makes up this amount because
 I still have
 no bills. Since March I have requested bills
 and as late as 6/18 was promised all old and
 current bills
 would be mailed to me so I
 could see my charges, promised
 credits and
 credit card payments that have been taken while
 talking to your service people to resolve
 this.
 Saturday 6/27, still not bills and
 now a promise to cut off
 service AGAIN!!!
 I can't believe you even let this
 notice get sent out during
 this inquiry.
 I can't believe I still have no bills. The
 last supervisor said I could count on him
 sending bills
 because he was a
 ""supervisor"". I told him all the prior
 promises were made by ""supervisors as
 well"" and I doubted if
 I ever would
 receive them. Correct again!
 I'm
 expecting to be cut off tomorrow and at this point,
 hardly care. I have spent going on 12 hours
 in the past 2
 weeks with you. My primary
 renter has a severe heart
 condition and I
 am a senior widow. We are both stressed
 out to the max.
 You called me and then
 sent this e-mail and it looks like
 that is
 all that has happened. When I spoke with you
 on the phone on 6/19, I told you I was not
 settling with you
 until I got bills and
 credits promised. Neither one
 have
 happened. Likewise, I'm a bit surprised that , in
 your email, you indicated that you would
 review my complaint
 and get back to me.
 Don't you think it would have been
 appropriate to review my complaint BEFORE you called and
 emailed me?
 This is exactly
 representative of the COMCAST service that I
 and everyone else complains about. Your
 insincere
 words mean nothing. You will
 drag out any situation as
 long as you can
 until the customer gets so frustrated they
 give up.

347789,Comcast data cap,6/18/2015,3:22:37 AM,Internet,Bloomingdale,Georgia,31302,Open,No,"Comcast has a 300 gigabyte data cap in my area, which used to be 300 gigabytes. It has become increasingly difficult to stay underneath that cap. Unfortunately, Comcast is the only Internet service provider in my area right now, besides AT&T who only provides a 700 kilobyte/sec internet connection in my area. The data cap is the same whether you have a 3 megabyte/sec connection or a 10 megabyte/sec connection. It is completely unfair that people with a faster connection be punished more because they exceed their data cap much quicker.
 Is there anything I can do to have my limit increased or removed all together?

358822,Comcast Issues,6/23/2015,3:05:04 PM,Internet,Bloomingdale,Georgia,31302,Pending,No,"My girlfriend and I have, on numerous occasions, contacted Comcast regarding poor performance on our home Internet speeds, in addition to price hiking. My usual method of communication is by phone but the redirection to different agents is awful, so my girlfriend used her Twitter account to contact Comcast publicly and directly. Our issues were resolved for some time but they continue to occur. These issues mainly revolve around my data speed being too slow. I pay for 25 mbps minimum from the provider and have records that they have been shown where speeds are not as advertised. I am educated and technically knowledgeable and they tried to explain the issues were router location, among other things (the router is in our open living room and the signal was awful within 3 feet of plain sight from the router). After a few added complaints, our issues were resolved quickly overnight. They persist occasionally, as recently as this weekend. It is unstable and unreliable, and I am not compensated for the lack of service that is advertised. In addition to the service issues, our account received a price increase without notice starting October 2014. Until I spoke with a manager about my issues, we were completed unaware of this price increase and had subsequently incurred a number of late penalties for the lack of payment (which was unfortunately set to auto pay a specific amount). These late fees and price increase were demanded to be paid in order to restore service earlier this year.
 Please, FCC, see this is made right!

249465,Comcast charging a fee without disclosing,4/22/2015,8:44:27 AM,Internet,Bloomington,Illinois,61701,Closed,No,"My internet was running slow on WiFi. I called in, spoke with a rep, and she did some troubleshooting that involved switching channels on the router, but that didn't help. So she scheduled someone to come out to my house and look at it- at no point in the conversation was a fee, or the possibility of a fee- mentioned.
 A technician came and changed the wiring- he said it was split multiple times, which probably had an impact. He did some work (I have no idea what he did) but it didn't really help. He ended up saying that if we really wanted to see a difference, we should buy our own modem and router and maybe something to boost our signal. Again- did not mentioned that a fee would be charged or a fee might possibly be charged.
 This month I realized that a fee was charged, but customer service will not waive it, despite acknowledging that it was wrong and I should've been notified. They negotiated waiving half of it- but I also did not receive any kind of mailing or other alert that the fee had been charged- and I ended up being charged a late fee- because the first fee was not paid. Moreover, they charged a late fee before giving us any notice or opportunity to make that payment!

360432,"Incorrect charges, and would not fix",6/23/2015,11:00:41 PM,Internet,Bloomington,Illinois,61701,Open,No,"A little over two weeks ago I moved to a new apartment. I went to purchase internet through Comcast since it is one of the only providers in my area for fast internet. I saw online a promotional price available in my area when I typed in my address until the beginning of the week of 6/21/15, for $39.99/mo for Blast! Internet at 50mbps for the first year. The second year was $54.99/mo, then after that would be the regular price of $76.95.. I purchased it online, set up my account, and my internet worked. I was surprised at how there was no hassle aside from conveniently not receiving an order confirmation email even though my order went through.
 On 6/18 or 6/19 I received my Comcast bill and I was being charged $76.95/mo for the internet service, and not the $39.99/mo that was shown on the website and the Order Information page before I actually submitted my order. I called Comcast support on the phone and each person I told about my issue said a variation of ""I can't do that, let me transfer you to this department who should be able to help you."" I was transferred through 5 people, before the 5th person went to transfer me to somebody else. While waiting for the 6th person to pick up, the line was disconnected. I called back and had to go through the whole automated thing again so I could talk to a person, and when being transferred to a person, the line disconnected me not once, but twice. I eventually reached another person who told me ""Oh, if its an online promotion we are unable to do anything about it over the phone. You need to use the online chat for this issue.""
 I then went to use the online chat and talked to one person who said ""That promotion does not exist and is not available in your area. The only offer available in your area is $59.99/mo for Internet Plus + Blast!"" So i asked him how this deal cannot exist if I am specifically looking at the deal right now that says its available for my area. He would not answer. Eventually our chat ended. Within moments of our chat ending, my person modem (not rented through Comcast) was restarted and I did not have internet for about 5-10 minutes. Convenient that it happened right after he had access to my account.
 I talked to a second chat person and she was extremely helpful and completely understood why I was unhappy. She noticed my account was improperly marked as a current customer rather than a new customer and that is why I was not given the promotional price. She notated my account that my package should be the Blast! $39.99/mo, but I had to call Customer Solutions Team and they would see the notation and fix my service in the system. I called them and ended up with a person from Billing I think who transferred me to somebody else who could help me. Even though my account was notated to be fixed, she would not fix it and said that the deal was not in her system for her to change it either. I again talked to somebody else who ALSO said that deal did not exist and that if it is an online promotion then they do not have access to it and the only way to get that promotion is to be a new customer and purchase online. This lady had an offer for $49.99/mo Blast! Internet, and offered me a $120 credit which would basically make it a $39.99/mo Blast! Internet. I still wasn't too happy
 but I wasn't sure if any other person would offer me this. I was still was concerned with my bill because I was being charged the full price for this month still, and she said I would just be given the credit on next months bill. But that doesn't solve the issue that I'll be paying 1 month at $76.95, and 11 months at $49.99 with a $120 credit. If I had the full 12 months at $39.99 I would end up paying $480, but with this $76.95 for 1 month + 11 months of $49.99 - $120 credit I'll be paying $506. She didn't seem to understand that. In addition to that, it would be $49.99/mo for the first year, then $69.99/mo for the second year, then the regular price of $76.95/mo afterwards meaning that the credit would only benefit me for the first year but I was still being screwed over on the second year by $180. I talked to another person and tried explaining it to her and she understand what I was concerned with but she also said she could not offer me the $39.99/mo promotion because it was not in the system even though that is what I confirmed my order on.
 So at this point, I was stuck with the $49.99/mo + $120 credit, but was screwed over for the second year. I looked at my account today (6/23/15) and I received credits of $8, $53.36, and $21.56, but at the same time I also received additional charges of $53.56 and $8. meaning I still had a credit of $21.56 on my account. However, it still says I owe Comcast the full price of the Internet. As a new customer I am completely disgusted with how they treated me.

367310,Suspected Throttling,6/26/2015,1:00:33 AM,Internet,Bloomington,Illinois,61704,Open,Yes,"I believe we are being throttled by Comcast. We are paying for 25Mbps down and I believe 5Mbps up. This equates to 3.125MB/s down and 0.625MB/s up. I have tested our speed using Speedtest.net (while no devices were downloading anything and everyone else in my house was sleeping, so I'm the only one online), and it determined we were not getting the speeds we are paying for. This may be tied to my family's data usage for this month, which would constitute throttling. Comcast's website also mentions a 250GB data threshold, which we don't have. I'm not sure why it would even be mentioned (even if they say they aren't enforcing it) unless they are just proving why they are throttling us.

 Comcast is forcing us to rent out their modem/router, which is raising our bill by $10 monthly. We don't want or need their equipment, but they sent it to us without warning around a year and a half ago and started charging us for it. Also, many of our devices are having trouble connecting to our internet recently, which probably has something to do with the throttling I mentioned in my previous complaint.

From the first day, I have had constant trouble logging on to the internet, or getting on to the internet only to have it cut off on me within minutes. I have had numerous techs out to fix this as well as the televisions inability to stay connected with the xfinity. I have complained until I am blue in the face, listened to one excuse after another, put up with numerous techs sent out to fix the problem, supervisors who promise but never deliver on going to the next level as far as fixing the problems. They all seem to agree that the two issues are connected, but no one is concerned enough to truly delve into the situation and fix the problem. Out of desperation, last month when talking to a supervisor, I said that the only reliable service and response from Comcast to me is that my bill arrives on time every month. I then said that I was having a true problem figuring out what I was actually paying for when I have received such sub par service, and really felt that until my service is fixed to my satisfaction, maybe I should just refrain from paying my bill. She then informed me what a foolish idea that was because it would only result in my disconnection with Comcast and the resulting damage to my credit.

I got a letter in the mail at the end of may telling me that on the 31st of May my internet service would be completely disconnected and that if I wanted to keep it I needed to pay the 100 something dollars past due balance plus the month of June's balance, so a total of 200 or so dollars. However it is now June 25th, my service has been deactivated but not disconnected like they said they would and they continue to add months of billing for service that I'm not receiving. Now the bill is over 300 dollars and includes not only the month of June which I couldn't use their internet service at all for but now also includes the month of July. I can't pay and shouldn't have to pay for months that I didn't/don't receive the service that they want me to pay for.

360666,Keep getting charged rental fees for modem I already own,6/24/2015,12:49:46 AM,Internet,Bloomington,Minnesota,55431,Solved,No,"I have a modem that I own, which Comcast keeps saying it is their modem. It is not. I purchased it on my own. I never even received any equipment from them at all when I first signed up for their broadband internet in early 2013, since I informed the Customer Service that I already had a modem. So I don't know how they can try and justify these charges, even after fighting (and resolving) the issue three times now.
 Ever since getting internet from Comcast, 1-2 times a year Comcast would add the rental charge to my bill without informing me about it. I had to fight the charge at a physical Xfinity (Comcast) store to get the charges reversed. I have to be vigilant on every bill!
 When I asked the customer service manager at an Xfinity store location, he informed me that Comcast does an audit multiple times a year, and my modem keeps incorrectly getting flagged as theirs. It is not theirs, I own the modem. I never even received any modem from them. I've talked with customer service over the phone many times, but they refer me back to the physical Xfinity store. It can only be taken care of in person.
 I have to drive to the location (my time and money for gas to drive there), plus time to wait in line for the privilege of getting my monthly bill fixed.
 I asked the customer service manager if he could put a note on my account that I own the modem, so it would stop charging my modem rental fee's, he told me Comcast does not have a system to track that. So 1-2 times a year I have to fight the bill because of this fraudulent modem rental charge. Over, and over again.
 I recently received a letter form Comcast dated 09 June 2015, that they will start charging me again for my modem that I own. No where in the letter does it say how to dispute this charge. I will again have to take time out of my day, spend money on gas, and put unneeded miles on my already-old car to drive to the Xfinity store just to get a cable internet bill that is correct.
 In summary, my complaint is that Comcast keeps fraudulently charging me Cable modem rental fees, mostly without informing me to allow me to dispute them, or even a reasonable way to dispute it so that I won't see these charges ever again. In the meantime, I have to pay a larger cable bill then I agreed upon when signing up for their internet service.

259141,Awful Service!,4/27/2015,2:13:15 PM,Internet,Boca Raton,Florida,33487,Closed,No,"I just started service with Comcast in a home I just rented. Technician came to my home and brought receivers, because the house already had service before we lived there. Comcast proceeded with charging me over $300 in installation fees, which were never disclosed to us. I called back 8 times trying to dispute these charges and was promised a call back from a supervisor on numerous occasions. After the 8th attempt, I was advised that a ticket was submitted and that a specialist would review and get back to me. I spoke to a representative and told them that I authorize a payment of $120 to be charged to my card until the specialist reviews all other fees. Instead they proceeded with charging me the full amount. When I called them back to have it credited, they refused to credit me the money back. I had to contact my bank and have the charges reversed. I have had service for 2 months and it has been the worst service ever! The signal drops all of the time. I have spent hours on the phone with them getting this resolved. I work a full time job and have 2 small children and shouldn't have to call comcast every single day and fight with them for hours on end. This company has provided me with the worst customer service, worst support, and horrible service. I just want to pay for the usage and receivers as I was told.

 and asked to disconnect one of the address. Once I got home I realized that they disconnected the
 wrong address and I called them right away. After a lot of back and forward I got the Internet back to
 work but at 3 mbit only instead of 25 mbit which is what I've been paying for a while. The customer
 care representative said that she couldn't do anything about it , it was a billing problem and she
 transferred me . The billing department said that the can't do anything about it, and put us on hold
 and after 30mins they dropped the call. I'm very tired of this situation, every time I have an issue with
 the service I feel like Im getting a heart attack, it's very frustrating to deal with Comcast service."
292598,Billing for equipment that was not provided to me,5/15/2015,5:48:59 PM,Internet,Boca Raton,Florida,33496,Open,No,"I have had service with Comcast at my home since 1999. I have always had my own modem for the
 internet connection with Comcast. In 2008 I asked Comcast to no longer provide me with television
 services and only provide me with internet access. I have always had my own modem for the internet
 access and NEVER leased a Comcast modem. I always had my bills paid automatically with direct
 charge to my credit card. In February 2015 I noticed that my bill increased. I reviewed the bill in
 detail and noticed that Comcast has been charging me for the television services and for leasing of a
 modem. I was able to access prior bills for only 9 months and all of them had the same charges. I
 contacted Comcast in February of 2015 and was on the phone with several representatives. I was
 assured that their accounting department will research this matter and refund me the money that was
 charged to me. I contacted Comcast twice since then and was told that the matter is being
 researched. As of today 5-15-2015, I have not received any communication or refund of the wrongful
 charges.
 I called Comcast today once again, because a $70 charge was noted on my bill due in two days for a
 service call. In fact we lost our Comcast Internet connection for 1 week last month. A service
 technician was called . Comcast informed me that we had to wait for 6 days for a technician to come.
 When he came, the technician identified a problem outside our home with a Comcast cable. He
 performed the repairs, all outside our home and restored the service. When I called today to dispute
 the $70 charge I was told by a representative that the paperwork showed that repairs were performed
 INSIDE my home. I stated to the representative that it is not true, and in fact to this day the new
 cable has not been berried in the ground and remains a danger to me and my family. The
 representative informed me that they will have to research the issue and determine if the repairs were
 performed inside or outside my home.
 Clearly Comcast is engaged in unlawful and deliberate overcharging to their customers for the
 equipment and services that area not performed. I am attaching the available bills as evidence of
 these problems with Comcast.

 does a speed test she gets 3Mbps download/1Mbps upload. She is going to purchase a new modem

 This morning, June 10th, I am unable to do the simplest task on my computer, for example, read and
 delete email. The speed I am receiving at the current time tested at 1.12 megabits per second. The
 performance package that I am paying for is supposed to be 25 megabits per second. My speed test
 results are variable but the highest result I have had is 10 megabits per second. Comcast does not
 seem able to provide me reliable ""high speed"" service. I am sure I am not the only customer being
 defrauded by Comcast and I have no intention of taking them to court. It would be good if people in
 my area had a real choice of providers. I, likewise, have no intention of letting their technicians near
 my equipment because it works perfectly all the time. It is the service that Comcast provides that
 doesn't work much of the time. I don't know why their ""highly trained technicians"" can't fix what is
 wrong with Comcast's service. What I want is what I am paying for High Speed Internet Service. In
 addition to paying for internet service I pay $70 a month for cable TV which I pay through my
 maintenance. For this amount I get basic service. The choice of programming for that large amount of
 money is so paltry that I don't watch TV most of the time.

 This morning, when I wrote the complaint, the speed that I received 1.18 megabits per second was
 with the new modem that I purchased for $75 because Comcast's representatives told me that I
 would not be able to receive high speed with the modem that I had. I purchased a new high speed
 modem that supposedly gets 343 megabits per second and I still did not get high speed. The highedt
 speed that it tested at was 10 megabits per second and most of the time it got a little more than 3
 megabits per second. After I made this complaint the new modem that I have started to reboot itself
 every few seconds. I became alarmed that something would break and I called support to tell them to
 (b) (6)
 stop fiddling with my modem. I was told that no one was doing anything to my modem. I removed the
 new modem and reattached the old modem which worked immediately. It tested at 3.5 megabits per
 second. I have no idea what to do to get high speed internet but at this point I don't think that I will get
 it from Comcast.

 Thank you for your assistance with my complaint against Comcast . I was initially pleased to receive an email from a Comcast executive in reference to my complaint which asked me to call them. I complied immediately and reached an answering device. I left my telephone numbers on the answering device for a Ms. Tonica Freeman . After a number of repeat calls reaching only an answering device I received an email from Tonica Freeman stating that was â€œ unable to reach meâ€.
 I checked my voice mail and missed calls list and find no such call was made to me nor were any messages left by Ms. Freeman so I must take it for granted that this was getting me nowhere.
 I have continued making calls daily to the number provided by Comcast and Tonica Freeman.I have a record of 7 calls yesterday made to the number provided 561-227-3426-3426. I enclose the record of such calls for yesterday June 25th. I have hit the proverbial stone wall.

Shame on me for not paying attention but I just noticed that they increased my monthly rental fee over a year ago and it's now $10 a month. They have never serviced it or replaced, so how can they justify the need for the price increase in my case. I know it's only $3 but multiply that by the millions of units they lease and it's an unjustified windfall for them.

234849,Comcast - issues galore,4/14/2015,2:07:23 PM,Internet,Bolton,Massachusetts,1740,Closed,No,"I will try to sum it up and bullet this out. Background is that we moved, and I contacted our service provider Comcast in February 2015 to make sure our TV, phone, and internet would be a seamless transfer. I spoke with Bob who told me how it would all work and assured me that we are all set. In the end, he was correct, but all the in between information was catastrophic. Bob said this was a ""transfer"" of services, so once we move, the TV and Phones will no longer exists (we will get a new phone number), but email will continue through our mobile devices until our service is hooked up at which point everything will be back. This was supposed to happen on March 22nd, it is now April 14th and we are still not up and running, no internet, emails, TV, phones, nothing. We moved on March 31st. Email disaster too.
 At this moment, I feel as though we (for all services) and all of our emails are being held hostage by Comcast. If we could change providers without massive disruption to our life, I would, but because I was informed that there would be no issues, therefore, we decided to wait to get our Comcast service at our new house. This was supposed to happen on March 22nd.
 I am usually the one who is accepting of situations when they are clearly articulated, knowledgeable, factual, and provided by someone who is committed to customers. This is not Comcast.
 Issues:
 1. Misinformed that our new house had service, therefore a technician will come March 22nd to hook us up there - wrong!
 2. Technician comes 3/22 and cannot help us, the line was severed, there is no service to connect - no lines from the street to the house (which is over 400ft). He will talk to his supervisor to get a ticket in.
 --- we move --- not a word from anyone at Comcast.
 3. No word on this for a few weeks - NOTHING, no confirmations, calls, nothing - but our email was still working. I just wanted to confirm that we were on the schedule for getting a line in, and then service hooked up.
 4. April 5th week, I decide to find out what is going on.... this is where it goes crazy.
 5. Spoke with a service rep Izzy to see if I could confirm we were all set. She said the tech will be there April 21st. I know this, I wanted to make sure the construction people that they arrange are coming soon to do this part. She said she did not see a construction order, but the tech will be there 4/21.
 6. Spoke with Izzy's supervisor, to find out what is going on, does the Tech dig a trench or go into the trees, she said ""no"". I asked who can I call to find out about the construction part - no construction, no tech needed. I wanted to know the construction order was in and a date he/she would be there.
 7. She gave me a number that was not correct - name was right.
 8. Called Bob who gave me a number, but through the prompter his name was not listed.
 9. I randomly hit a number, left a message for someone to have the construction guy - Dave please call me. He did, he was great. (he is not affiliated with Comcast).
 10. In the meantime, our email was disconnected on April 12th - no clue why.
 11. Called to find out what is the problem here are some of the responses I got:
 * no clue
 * it is just disconnected, that is what happens
 * your email was not flagged as a transfer
 * I am so sorry, you have lost everything
 * your email stays active for 2 weeks and then disconnects
 * No you didn't lose everything, just from April 12 - 21st when you should have service back - those will be gone
 * Your account is flagged as a transfer so once your service is connected, it will all be there
 I spoke to four people - finally the last one Pat, seemed to get it right, but I don't trust anything from them right now. She asked me when the construction people will be there -- I said ""how would I know this, you guys hire them, they work for you..""
 13. I asked ""why"" should I stay a customer of yours (to Jessica) - she said ""we have the fastest internet""... considering I have nothing right now, no one ever said our internet would disconnect, NOTHING that this was going to happen. 14. I said ""why"" would I pay for your service going forward"" - I told her I did not want to pay for this service for a year. She had no answer, except ""let me review your plan"" thinking she could help us save money there.... I have no plan! I have nothing right now~
 I am absolutely blown away by the number of people and supervisors I have spoken to, all because I heard nothing and thought I would give a call to see where it all stands. I am a person who plans, takes action and ensures that things are all set when they happen, no glitches, no surprises.
 Due to their lack of knowledge, lack of communication, lack of true customer service, and one customer just checking in... 6 weeks later I learned how incompetent, uncaring and disinterested they are in their customers. I got different answers every time I spoke with someone. As I went up the chain and would get a ""supervisor"" on the phone, the story always changed (usually for the better, but never fully correct). Unfortunately, supervisors have absolutely no authority, and as one said ""my hands are tied"". I asked if I could speak with someone who didn't have their hands tied.. I finally got Pat. She said she would call me right back and 2 hours later, I am still waiting.
 I have spent hours and hours on the phone with them, on hold, shuffled from department to department, trying to find out where things stand, why things happened, trying to find out the truth, and all for what...? because I want my email back. Hostage - we are being held hostage by Comcast. I do not want to pay for a service that is as corrupt as they are, however, they have my life on hold as I have saved critical emails from the past that are important to our family life. Lesson learned.

 Our story continues.... although our email is now up and running (we lost 3 days), we were very much looking forward to our service being hooked up on April 21st - construction order in place, all set! I am counting the hours~!! Today, April 17th, we received an email from comcast ""confirming the change to our appointment to May 15th!"" Are you kidding me. Neither of us called to change this. Called comcast, appears a technician changed this, no notes, no email of who did it (I think his name is Bob cause someone slipped), no clue from the customer solutions. Unbelievable. We are standing our ground to be hooked up on April 21st. The customer support person put us back on the schedule for April 21st, however, we need a construction guy to come out too, she is working on this. We are at a total loss. Cannot believe someone change this, and the email said it was ""confirming our change order"".. See below:

As far as I know Comcast has signed an agreement with our LFA that disallows other companies from getting into the market. This creates a monopoly as they are the only high-speed provider available unless we move out of town which is unreasonable to ask to have a different ISP with similar speed offerings. Due to the requirements of many web sites and services DSL service, which I am currently using from Verizon, is becoming increasingly insufficient for average use cases.

They added on a DVR and HD box when this was specifically not requested, fees of which amount to an additional 20/month, when none of this was explained or even asked for by the customer. Despite having a receipt (that they acknowledge), stating my original bill was supposed to be 54.99/month, they overcharged and are refusing to lower it below 74.99/month for the remainder of the year.
 They refuse to take off the HD fee of 10/month, despite the fact that it was nowhere to be found in the promotion OR receipt they sent me. I asked to take this off as I did not sign up for the service but they state that is not possible, and also told me they have no ability to fix my current bill but I should overpay and they will ""fix it later"" - my first bill was $150 (with installation ...for a service that is supposed to be $54.99!

362450,Unfair billing practices of Comcast,6/24/2015,3:40:31 PM,Internet,Boston,Massachusetts,2115,Solved,No,"My only available broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television from my service package. I was ""forced"" into taking a package initially when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this package was 50 dollars a month. Internet service on its own without cable was 65 dollars a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and have just never watched cable television. For the past 3 year my bill has been slowly creeping upwards until it has now reached over 70 dollars a month for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

292412,False contract repersentation,5/15/2015,4:34:23 PM,Internet,Boulder,Colorado,80304,Solved,Yes,"My neighbor has Xfinity/Comcast service for phone, Internet and cable TV. I was on the phone
 helping her drop Internet service (onlyÂ¬) and trying to find out how much she would pay monthly for
 the reduced service.
 I was told she had to pay $180 to be released from her contract, a contract that she didnâ€™t remember,
 but that Comcast claimed prevented her from downgrading her service for three years.
 After a half-hour of back and forth, the representative admitted that my neighbor had only been
 â€œpresentedâ€ with the contract, but she had never â€œacceptedâ€ it. At this point I was put on hold and
 transferred to another representative, who, after more back and forth we may have given us the
 information we were requesting, I say â€œmayâ€ because we are not sure. All we were trying to learn was
 what would be her monthly bill if she dropped her internet service and kept her cable TV and phone
 service the same as it is now. This should be a simple, easily answered question. What we heard
 from the second representative was convoluted and not entirely clear.
 I interpret the statement, â€œYou have a contract that says you must pay $180 to drop serviceâ€ as
 fraudulent behavior on Comcastâ€™s part. I cannot prove that it is standard operating procedure, but it
 did not feel like it was a singular incident. It felt like the representative was trained to mislead callers
 about non-existent â€œcontractsâ€ when they sought information about dropping service.
 In addition, I think that it was completely unreasonable for Comcast to take an hour to answer a
 simple question about the cost of reduced service. The delay, the questions, and the passing us to
 another representative felt like an intentional practice on Comcastâ€™s part to discourage individuals
 from reducing service. I recently had another, entirely positive, swift experience when I called about
 initiating service with Comcast."
370586,"Extremely low speeds, and no help",6/27/2015,9:57:04 PM,Internet,Boulder,Colorado,80303,Open,No,"Hi,
 I am currently paying for a 50 Mbps connection through Xfinity (Comcast) in Boulder, CO. This morning when I woke up however, the download speed I received was less than 1 Mbps. I then called Xfinity support and tried to solve the problem with the Xfinity representative, but 1.5 hours later nothing had been solved and (I believe) out of frustration, the Xfinity representative hung up on me. I called back immediately and asked to speak to a supervisor, after being on hold for over 25 minutes, I was told the supervisor was 'unavailable' and I could expect a call-back within 1 hour. This was about 8-9 hours ago, and I still have not heard a single thing. Just before filing this complaint, I called Xfinity support again to try to figure it out, and actually got to speak to a supervisor. I was told the slow speeds are, and I quote: ""completely normal, and nothing to be worried about"". I told the supervisor that this is unacceptable, as I have paid for a service which I am not receiving. Right after saying this, I got hung up on again. I am absolutely irate at the horrendous quality of Xfinity/Comcast's customer support service, and I would like an explanation about why customers are being treated this way. Also, while testing my internet speeds, I noticed something interesting. I ran 4 different speed tests, Speedtest.net, att.com/speedtest, bandwidthplace.com, and of course Comcast's own speedtest.comcast.net. Speedtest and Bandwidthplace gave me results of under 1 Mbps, and the AT&T test couldn't even complete due to the slow speeds. The Xfinity speedtest however shows I have a high speed connection of around 30 Mbps, even though I can barely even watch a YouTube video at a 480p resolution. To me this concludes that the Xfinity/Comcast speed test is wildly inaccurate, to a point where I actually feel lied to. To verify, I have included screen shots of the different speed tests I ran (all taken within 5 minutes of each other). Is there perhaps another explanation for this situation? Upload speeds however are normal at around 12 Mbps, which shows that the problem is not on my end. Thank you very much.

 April 23, which at that point I still had
 issues with the internet speed.

212818,Incorrect Billing,4/1/2015,5:39:39 PM,Internet,Boynton Beach,Florida,33426,Closed,No,"A customer service representative from Comcast Xfinity contacted me back in January 2015 offering internet service for $19.99/month for 12 months, which I accepted and agreed to the addition at the promotional rate. Once I received my March-15 statement from Comcast Xfininty I was being charged $34.99/month for internet service. I contacted Comcast Xfininty same day and spoke with a representative in which she told me I was upgraded to a faster speed at a higher price. This was not the agreed promotion I discussed with representative back in January-15, and I did not authorize any upgrades for internet service. We discussed only the promotional rate of $19.99/month and I would like a credit for the difference and the promotional rate of $19.99/month to be applied to all future bills until promotion expires as agreed.
 In the attached below, I have attached the email confirmation of the internet service added to my account at a rate of $19.99/month for 12 months, and I have attached the March 15 billing statement with the incorrect charges of $34.99/month.

338907,Comcast - Diversified Consultants,6/13/2015,11:48:10 AM,Internet,Bozeman,Montana,59715,Closed,No,"Hi,
 I relocated from San Francisco to Montana in a hurry due to job offered. I took the comcast equipment with me to Montana because I didn't have time to return.
 I got a chance to called comcast sometime in last November/Early December about the equipment that I have with me them. The gentleman I spoke to told me that I just need to pay off and return the equipment and that would be it. I don't have to do anything else. I paid my ""balance"" when I called comcast a couple days before Christmas 2014 and was told that I have no balance with comcast but I should call Comcast in later in January 2015 to see if I have any balance left. It didn't make any sense because he just told me that I am all clear. He said that I need to call in to close my account. I don't have any balance left but my account still needed to be closed.
 I called in a couple times in January an was waited for almost 45 mins each time. I gave up because I was thinking that since I own comcast nothing and my old apt in SF was already rented then I should be able to move on with my life.
 In March 2015, I have a letter from Diversified Consultants with the message that I need to pay for $211.12 from account with comcast.
 I contact comcast again after I got the letter and they didn't want to communicate with me. It is not right for me to have to pay any extra than what I owed because I paid for the service and I return the equipment.
 If they want all their customer to call again after all just to close their account then they should make it more convenience for the consumer/their customers. There are multiple ways to do this but comcast chose to have the least inconvenience ways to deal with the customers who wanted out. To be honest, I only cancel comcast because they don't have service here in Bozeman.
 I finally have to money to pay today 6/13 which I end up paying $221.12 ( $10 process fee with Diverified).
 I am very upset because comcast took advantage of the situation. They make it very difficult to close the account which I have try my best to follow their rules. I couldn't becasuse I can't wait more that 45mins to close my account?!?
 I need my money back, $221.12. Please.

228369,Comcast blocks HBO GO on PS4,4/10/2015,11:17:48 AM,Internet,Brandon,Mississippi,39047,Closed,No,"I pay Comcast for Internet in conjunction with HBO. With that subscription comes the claim for HBO GO on the device of my choosing. Comcast has blocked HBO GO from the Playstation 3 as well as 4. This is blatant disregard for Comcast consumers. It seems to be an attempt to push consumers to buy a product of Comcast's choosing since my laptop and cellphone use the service fine. I have no problem waiting for contract negotiations but for over a year now this service has been blocked on the Playstation 3. Companies a fraction of the size in relation to Comcast have access to this service. Now consumers are trapped in contracts with Comcast with no way to request this service besides a forum that does nothing to give timeline, help or empathy. Please help to resolve this issue for all of us who feel betrayed by a company seeking to herd it's costumers like sheep to gain extra profit margins.

As we do not subscribe to cable or satellite TV, relying on free antenna and streaming video instead, we routinely hit the cap and are subject to an overage fee. It's wrong and these caps are an attempt by Comcast to limit what people use the Internet for. The only reason that Comcast is doing this is to try to recoup money lost to ""cord cutters"" like us and try to prevent people for patronizing Comcast competitors such as Netflix and Amazon instant video. Adding insult to injury, the damned internet is out at least once a week but that's a whole other story. Please stop the insanity!

358865,Comcast Bandwidth Billing Issue,6/23/2015,3:12:16 PM,Internet,Brandon,Mississippi,39047,Solved,No,"Comcast is billing me based on data usage, but I have no visibility into the source of the traffic that is causing my bill to be extremely high.
 For the past several months I've gone over my 300 gigabyte limit by around 300 gigabytes resulting in $50-$60 of additional charges on my bill.
 If they are going to charge for usage, they need to provide customers with tools to manage that usage allowing us to limit bandwidth allocated to a given service, site, or protocol.
 They should also provide us with details on what service, site, or protocol resulted in the bandwidth usage.
 I would switch to another provider, but they have a monopoly in my area.
 There are no comparable internet options in my area.
 Knowing the amount of data I am using is not helpful unless I disconnect my Internet when I am approaching my limit.

362663,Comcast Internet speeds,6/24/2015,4:21:50 PM,Internet,Branford,Connecticut,6405,Solved,No,"I pay for Comcast blast speed which is advertised at 105 mbps. I increased my speed in December 2014, I was told I need to use their router and modem to achieve those speeds and spent over 4 hours troubleshooting with customer support the first day alone trying to reach those speeds. It never happened, i purchased my own router and was able to get close to the 90s here and there. The past 3 months I range from 15-65. I purchased my own modem and have been averaging high 70s, 90s everyone once in a while. I've asked comcast for a credit considering how slow my speeds were and I shouldn't have to pay full price when only receiving 60% of service. I know that if I was to pay only 60% my service would be disconnected pretty quickly. When I bring it up with customer service they laugh and say ""thats not how it works"" They also have somewhat of a monopoly of my area. The only other provider is Frontier and they cannot deliver speeds over 6 mbps, I do a lot of work from home and need the faster speeds. Please look into this, I am confident I am not the only one who's experienced this.

Each person that shows up at our house tells us it is something else and has to reschedule another person to show up making us take another day off from work. The wire was replaced from our home to the pole and that person said there was not enough bandwidth to give us steady streaming and we should buy biz class. we did and nothing changed, another person came and said it was our equipment so we bought another different apple modem or router thing and that still did not help. We called and the person on the phone sold us 105 speed service and said that would fix the system coupled with moving our equipment which we scheduled comcast to come to the house and do. The person never showed up. another lost day of work. Then they sent another guy who replaced our equipment and said the system did not have to be moved but he could not get good access and said there is a throtteling problem? and the issues is at the pole. he told us that we would never get the advertised 105 as the fine print says ""up to"" and not to expect much more than what we are getting because of the lack of band width to the neighborhood. He scheduled someone to fix the issue at the pole on a saturday, we waited home all day and no one showed. Today we have no service at all. I left messages and emails for comcast and they finally returned my call today and wanted me to take another day from work. I am very frustrated that internet is way slow and the cable programs can only be watched with blackout interruptions every few minutes. We are tired of giving up vacation days to people that cant fix the problem and are tired of being up sold to things that dont deliver what we are told they deliver. We have no options as comcast is the only cable company we have. What to do??

 While I have taken time off from work to meet the comcast people at my home they still have not fixed the issue. My tv programs just stop playing and the screen says looking for signal. I have upgraded to the 105 per the person on the phone but the comcast person that came to my home said getting 20 or 30 is acceptable because it is UP TO 105 not 105. Speed tests are erratic on our computer and were on the technicians setup. I want to know what is expected from a 105 service and should it be delivered consistently or not. If Comcast ie throttling the amount of bandwidth as one of their techs said they do should that be my issue? Is there enough bandwidth coming in to my neighborhood? Why does this company cause me so much stress and my PTO days wasted on non performance? I took a day off to have a guy not show. I did receive a call yesterday from another rep who wants me to take yet another day off or give up half of my sunday to hang around so another rep can check what the past three did. HELP!!!!!!

We can not get or try fios as for some reason it is not allowed here in Brick NJ Can someone please give me an answer as to why my house has to have beyond slow service speeds? Lastly I asked the comcast person after I was sold the 105 speed package what level is acceptable as I found out only after I bought this that it is UP TO 105 meaning it could be 5 or 10mbps upload and they will still be true to the program. WHat is acceptable continuous service when you advertise 105? Is it 50?80? or 30? We need some help so my kids can do homework at home and not have to go to the library to use internet. I appreciate the FCC but if you just pass my comments and expect them to do more than call me you may be mistaken. Who else shall I complain to my senators? Congressman? Governors office? WHats next?"
360353,Comcast,6/23/2015,10:26:37 PM,Internet,Brick,New Jersey,8724,Solved,No,"Comcast is the only Broadband ISP available in my area. Because of this, I have to pay more for services I do not use. I had the Blast Internet (125 Mb/s Down 10 Mb/s Down) which is the fastest package available. I had this for a year, and paid about $47 a month. After a year, I would have had to pay $80 for the standalone internet package. I called their Customer Solutions department and they told me that I had to get cable to get a better deal. I do not use cable TV since I have Netflix and other streaming sites and apps. Therefore, I was forced into getting more services than I use to make my bill go down each month. They did throw in HD free for a year, but that is about 25 channels as I got the lowest TV package.
 I would love to take my business elsewhere, however, there are no other providers in my area that meet the FCC standard of broadband.

360370,Comcast,6/23/2015,10:35:42 PM,Internet,Brick,New Jersey,8724,Solved,No,"I believe it is false advertisement when they claim that you can get an internet package for $54.99, but then charge you a $10 modem rental fee and other fees that are not regulatory or government imposed. The cost of the device rental should be waived since the device has to be returned when the service contract ends, or should be a part of the base price for the package. I purchased service through them in the past, and renewed service since and they always quote a good price and there is always at least a $15-20 difference from what I am told I will pay.
 Also, last year my service was cut without a good enough reason. It took them a month to tell me what I needed to turn it back on. In the end, I had done what they required a week into the dispute and they said it didn't work. So I did the same exact thing again, and they accepted it. I was never formally apologized to by the company for the frustration of not having service for a month when it was clearly an issue on their end. I would simply like a written apology from the company about that issue that is on file.

 According to what I have read in the paper and on line, Comcast/Xfinity will be issuing their customers a $5.00 credit for the days loss of telephone and internet, which doesn't seem enough for all the missed calls and emails. They have never before authorized a credit for any other time we were without service. We will have to wait and see if this truly happens. Thank you for your response.

300066,Unauthorized billing,5/20/2015,5:28:54 PM,Internet,Brier,Washington,98036,Solved,No,"I have been a Comcast customer for many years, we were forced to move about 9 months ago and
 with nowhere to go we temporarily moved in with family. There was no need anymore to pay for
 Internet, but I liked Comcast and wanted to keep my email address with them and re-connect as soon
 as we were able to get back into our own home. I called Comcast to see what my options were, and
 they informed be that I could suspend my account for a small fee (somewhere around $8-10/month)
 and that would keep my account on hold but still be able to use the email. I thought that sounded
 good and agreed to that. The home buying process took way longer than expected, and after about 8
 months, I noticed my bill from Comcast was over $100. Shocked, I called them to see what
 happened, and that is when they informed me that I could only suspend my account for 6 months and
 when that time period was up, they started charging me for full service at a house I did not live at. I
 explained to them that no one told me that information and asked if that time could be extended.
 They said there was no way to do that and I would have to pay full price to keep my email going. I
 refused and went ahead and cancelled my account. I tried to talk to them about reducing my bill to
 the amount I expected to pay for that time, but was told to contact billing to discuss that. Their
 attempt to transfer to billing ended up in being disconnected. Other attempts were made to get in
 touch with them but were unsuccessful. Tired of trying, I decided to wait until I got my final bill to see
 if they fixed it or not. I never got a bill from them, I did however start getting phone calls asking me to
 verify my social security number so they could discuss a business matter, that seemed odd so I would
 not provide the information. Shortly after that, I received a collection notice in the mail from a
 collection company about the Comcast account for a balance of $108. I called the company, which
 was very polite and understanding and noted on my account that I was going to try to resolve this with
 Comcast. Again, multiple attempts were made to get to billing just to get the after hours message
 (sometimes during business hours). Finally I got through to someone, explained the situation, and
 only offered a $8 credit and still asked for $100. Asked to speak with the supervisor, at which point I
 learned that at some point one of the agents I spoke with lied about my conservation and
 documented that I understood about the 6 month time limitation. I was not informed about that until 8
 months into the account hold, two months after raising my rates without me knowing. The supervisor
 was rude and insisted that I was aware of the 6 month rule and refused to credit my account, and
 demanded I pay the full $108. Now, I am in the middle of trying to close on purchasing my house
 which might be in jeopardy due to Comcast's dishonest practices."
257589,Billing overcharges,4/26/2015,9:46:58 AM,Internet,Brigantine,New Jersey,8203,Closed,No,"I had to fight with Comcast to reduce my bill to the winter rate. It took 4 long phone calls and 2 web discussions before I was finally put onto the winter rate some time in January. I started in early October. I got some credit back but have no idea how much credit. Then I got a bill on April 24 telling me I owed $178 because they resumed my TV and internet service at a higher rate starting March 31. I called again and was told they reduce the service to basic service retroactive to March 31 where I would pay $67 a month. I was told I wouldn't come off of winter service until I called and I planned to resume service in May. I had no choice but to accept the deal to pay $67 a month starting March 31. I was told they would send me an email with the details of what I owe. I have yet to receive any details. REally getting tired of getting scammed by Comcast.

255005,Billing Over Charges,4/24/2015,12:12:01 PM,Internet,Brighton,Michigan,48116,Closed,No,"Comcast is over charging me by about $10 each month. They agree it is an over charge. I want them to bring my account balance to $0, erasing all late fees and $5 administrative assistance charges and begin charging me correctly $34.34 as I was charged in my first bill August of 2014.
 When I last talked with Comcast they wanted me to pay the over charge bill in full before the credit is applied. They say that the next bill will be lower and that it will then be corrected. I want the credit applied and I will continue to pay them only what I correctly owe. In January I spoke with a women in billing and we agreed I would pay $35.63 each month. (Which is higher then my first bill.) The problem has not resolved. The billing is not consistent and the roll over of overcharges which then incur a late fee is ridiculous! I attached my first bill and then the December and January bills which show a few changes. The April bill is also attached, it is the most currant as of this filing.

358608,Internet Only,6/23/2015,2:22:52 PM,Internet,Bristol,Connecticut,6010,Solved,No,"I am very frustrated with the service that I get from Comcast. When I originally signed up for their service, it was offered at a lower rate for the cable/internet bundle, which I was alright with, though I didn't want to have cable since I never actually watch it. The internet speed that they offered though was a good speed, so I decided to just suck it up and go with them. I started off paying about $64 per month in July 2014 for their Internet Plus bundle of 10 channels and 25 Mbps, to them raising the rate in January 2015 to about $68, and in May to $78! I ended up calling them to remove cable entirely from my bill, and they wanted to charge me $70 for just the 25 Mbps internet! I ended up having to sign up for 6 Mbps (A HUGE cut in the speed I had been using) in order to not spend an arm and a leg for the services I WANT to use. I think it's incredibly under-handed that they have the audacity to charge more for just internet service especially when it's the same speeds as in the bundle.
 I would cancel their service altogether, but the only other service we have in our area is AT&T U-Verse, and their service is historically spotty around where I live, and living in this day and age without having internet is no longer an option.

 2) My job is uncertain since I work for Time Warner Cable (the very company they were going to
 purchase)!!

 1) The work order that I told them I signed (which states ""Work Order"" at the top and has my
 signature).
 2) A 5 page document that I have never seen before, is not filled out by me and most importantly, it is
 NOT SIGNED BY ME!!! WHO'S SIGNATURE IS THAT!?! It looks nothing like my name/signature -

365533,Over paying for my Comcast Services,6/25/2015,2:36:20 PM,Internet,Brockton,Massachusetts,2302,Solved,Yes,"Several times I've called Comcast to try to lower my overly charged services, which includes Highspeed Internet and Cable TV, but have had no success.
 We don't use Cable TV at home, and one of the reasons we don't watch cable is because of the box they've provided us with is not HD, and all of the channels have black vertical lines on the side. And this is when my free to air antenna that cost me $14 at Walmart picks up beautiful quality channels.
 We mostly use the highspeed internet, which includes surfing the web, as well as streaming videos.
 I've tried to lower my bill by asking them to remove all of the cable packages and they always tell me how much more I would end up paying.
 Why can't i just have a decent 100Mbps highspeed internet package and pay $35 a month being that I own my own cable modem.
 I've tried looking for different providers, but the only other one available in my area is Verizon, which only provides DSL, a subpar speeds.

In May, Comcast raised my rate to over $80 per month with absolutely no warning or notice (I was specifically told when I was opening my account that I would have plenty of notice before any price increase) . Since I do not have any need for Cable TV or Phone services, I was told that my only option was paying over $55 per month for a slower internet only plan. After saying I will be canceling my service and switching providers, a manager was able to offer a slower internet only package at 50 Mps, at a rate of $44.99 per month.
 Now, ever since I switched to a lower speed plan, I rarely receive the advertised rates I pay for (consistently see speeds averaging 12/Mps), and am paying $10 more per month for half the speed I used to get (from 105 Mps to 50 Mps).

 Hello,
 I would like to add additional information regarding our Comcast account. We had a Comcast technician stop by on 6/25/2015 to try and diagnose the issues behind our very low speeds (12Mbps average - paying for 50Mbps). He was not able to find any issues, and during his visit, we were receiving the full 50+Mbps. Only a couple of hours later, our speeds dropped drastically back down to 10-12 Mbps - http://results.speedtest.comcast.net/result/941730544.png. I am not sure if our speeds are consistently being throttled, but ever since we were forced to switch plans, we rarely see over 20% of the speeds promised.
 We have tried everything, however Comcast is not willing to resolve the issue. We went from paying $34.99 a month for 105Mbps, to paying $45 a month for 50Mbps and only receiving an average of 12Mbps.
 All the best, (b) (6)

362230,Have to bundle services to get advertised proce.,6/24/2015,2:45:05 PM,Internet,Broomfield,Colorado,80021,Solved,No,"I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.

 To Whom It May Concern,
 I have two items Iâ€™d like to address:
 - Merging of tickets:
 It looks like both of my requests have been merged into a single ticket. At first glance theyâ€™re both comcast issues and it makes sense to tie them together, but I believe those cover two very different behaviors and warrant different investigations. I have since received a voice mail from comcast which only addressed the exclusivity policy and not the throttling. Could we split these tickets up so that they can be once again addressed individually? I would also like the issue of Netflix throttling to be addressed.
 - Response to exclusivity:
 I received a voice mail from a comcast spokes person who made it clear that if I didnâ€™t like this behavior I should contact my apartment complex rather than comcast. The reason I filed an FTC complaint and not a complaint with my apartment is because I have absolutely no power to understand the inner dealings of these contacts. If I complain to comcast they will just say itâ€™s my apartment who brokered these deals, and if I go to my apartment complex they might even corroborate that version of the story. My hopes in filing this complaint were to make sure that I could believe these two third parties. I simply have no way of knowing for certain why I am being charged so much. I would still like the FTC to reassure me directly, rather than take these corporations at their word.
 Thank you for your help,

 I am writing you because after calling several times and attempting to speak with a supervisor and still no luck I am skipping the middle man and going straight to the top! I am sick of the lack of customer service your company provides! It all started when I contacted your company on behalf of my Grandmother because her TV has been blacking out every 3 minutes for a year now. She has called several times to get this resolved and still no one has fixed it so I stepped up to the plate. While on the phone I also questioned her bill that was $140 for TV and phone and they informed me she has internet which we canceled a year ago. Your
 Rep then informed me a technician while on the phone with her talked her into upgrading her plan. For one a technician should not ever be a sales rep because the last I checked their job was to fix not sell! So my grandmother changed her plan because she was assured this would solve her blacking out issue. This is very dishonest and tells me your company takes advantage of seniors and cares
 more about sales than customer service. I then asked to speak to a supervisor and she told me it would be 72 hrs before I would speak to one which is also ridiculous! What company that values customer satisfaction has that type of policy? However I thought 72 hrs was long but it's now been almost 2 weeks and still no supervisor! I then called again and spoke to Danielle who set up for a technician to come and look at my grandmas TV this being the 3rd technician to come out and I asked if its not resolved what I would need to do to cancel. She told me there was no early termination fee because my grandma didn't sign a two year contract.( Guess your sales technician forgot to add that clause while selling her!) thank the Lord or so we thought! So the 3rd technician Michael Cox came out on Sunday June 7th and stayed for 4 hours he climbed the pole and changed out all of the connections and box and it still didn't fix the issues and continued to black out every 3 minutes! Danielle also assured me she would contact me and follow up with me Monday June 8th to tell me the amount I would be refunded for the TV blacking out and shocker she never did! So I then called And spoke to brittney who said there was no way of getting back in touch with Danielle which I know isn't true because each person I talk to is in your computer system and the calls are recorded! But I talked to brittney and she gave me her id number (952) so I could supposedly speak to her again which didn't work! She also assured me there was no ETF and I told her I wanted to speak to a supervisor and she connected me finally after waiting 40 mins to Arimis who also assured me there was no $200 ETF because she didn't sign a contract and it was in the notes on my grandmas account that she wouldn't be charged! She also said all she could do was credit me $60 for my TV blacking out for a year which is such a tiny amount compared to the problems we have encountered! So now 3 of your employees on different occasions have assured me we wouldn't be charged an ETF! And when we went to our local Comcast in Brunswick Ga they told us there was no notation and that she would be charged an ETF! This infuriated me so I then contacted your company again and still no response from a supervisor so I have contacted the FCC and you.This is a company with no integrity and no customer service from my experience so far! I want to be credited for her lack of TV for a year and for the Internet we didn't know we had for a year and I want the $200 fee removed! Please contact me at

I could go on But i dont know how in depth to get.
 Please help, this is the most frustrating experience I have ever had with a service provider, and I know many people with similar issues with Comcast. Please help, they have been treating customers as expendabl While charging premium (even unnapproved, bogus charges at times).

I originally ordered online then my order got cancelled, five times in a row. I also attached correspondence I had with a Comcast employee about the package and price I wanted. After all the back and forth I finally got the order confirmed with a phone representative for 74.94 (including HD technology fee and leased modem â€“ 54.99/month base fee). Furthermore the agent told me to pickup my modem and cable box at my local Comcast store â€“ 116 Beacon St. Somerville, MA 02144. When I got to the store, a woman at the counter told me that her colleagues on the help line are often wrong and that I should understand because Comcast is such a large national organizational. She cancelled my latest confirmation (I believe the 8th of the day) then went ahead and charged me a higher rate than I previously agreed with.
 I have now spent over 14 hours between setting up my order and trying to straighten out my billing. Every Comcast employee I talk to tells me a different story about the package. I simply just want a decent internet connection at a decent price and I shouldnâ€™t have to go through this hassle to receive a basic commodity. The cable and premium packages were just a bonus as Comcast had a promotional deal. I believed I attached all the relevant forms but I would be willing to discuss my situation in great detail over the phone.

 12 months HBO free

301085,difficulty to cancel services before moving,5/21/2015,12:10:49 PM,Internet,Cambridge,Massachusetts,2141,Solved,No,"I called in on April 20, 2015 to request for a cancellation of Comcast services at 101 1st St,
 Cambridge, MA 02141. I am closing this business location and moving out. The reason I did not call
 Comcast earlier was to avoid confusion or service interruption due to misunderstanding. Most service
 providers such as Verizon asked their customers not to call too early and better to wait until they are
 almost ready to move. I thought I was doing a good deed to Comcast to wait until timing was right to
 cancel services.
 I was dumbfounded to be told by the Comcast representative that the service could not be
 disconnected until late June. My account contract had already expired a long time ago. When I first
 signed up many years ago, I was never informed by the initial sales person that there was such a
 policy.
 After I presented my concern, the representative told me that in order to have the account closed
 effective 4/30/2015 I could send them a copy of lessor's official letter on company letterhead to prove
 that my business is moving out, as an alternative. I explained that I already had email conversations
 to prove that and there is no need for an official letter by the landlord, not to mention I never agreed to
 such a policy. I did NOT need to do this, but I had emailed the lessor and enclosed our emails here.
 The lessor thought it was ridiculous what Comcast asked. It was outrageous to spend hours and
 hours to follow Comcast's absurdity.
 I have always paid my invoices on time. We purchased our own modem and there is no equipment to
 return.
 I have written letters to Comcast to express my concern. I also faxed and emailed. Nobody replied. I
 have no other way to resolve this but have to come here for help. I simply want to make sure the
 Comcast service was canceled in the above location by April 30, 2015 and I shall not be billed for any
 service in this location after April 30, 2015. Any invoice prorated shall cover a period up to and only
 up to April 30, 2015. I really need to have a written confirmation by Comcast that the above is done.
 Given such a level of distrust on Comcast I cannot have any peace in mind until I see their final
 confirmation."
340458,Comcast Incompetence/Lies/Robbery,6/15/2015,9:14:44 AM,Internet,Cambridge,Massachusetts,2138,Open,No,"12 days ago I called Comcast to request internet service for my new apartment. I spoke with my apartment building's ""Residential Comcast Consultant,"" Brian Leyden <brian_leyden@cable.comcast.com>. I was very clear that all I wanted was internet. No TV. No Phone. No Home Security. I just wanted internet. He says great, it will be $39.99/month for 105 mbps and drops off a internet self-install kit at my apartment complex. A few days later I attempt to activate the device with no luck so I call customer service. They inform me that the only service I've been signed up for is Basic Cable and that they're not sure how I got a wireless gateway in the first place becuase I was never signed up for internet service. I spend an hour on the phone with them while they fail to activate my service and device. Then they say they'll ship a new device to me overnight at no charge. The next day I get a bill for $175 that shows me being charged for basic cable that I never asked for, for the internet package I requested, for a $60 install service charge, and for the shipping cost of two devices, one of which is supposedly shipped overnight and the other shipped 3-5 business day speed. The device that was supposedly shipped overnight never arrived. 4 days later I get the standard shipping rate device. It doesn't work either. I call customer service again. They tell me I'll need to either go pick up a new device from a customer service center or have a tech come out for which they might charge me $50. I didn't think it was appropriate to be charged for a technician so I went to the customer service center and tried installing one last device. Of course it did not work so now I am scheduling a technician to come to my apartment and will have to fight to have fees removed after the fact. Now more than 10 days after I was promised internet service I have no service, I have wasted hours and hours of my life, and I have a series of completely nonsensical bills charging me for services, fees, and devices that I either never wanted, never received, or just plain did not work. Moreover, I have repeatedly contacted Brian to see if he can help resolve the issue and he has completely ignored me.

357799,"Comcast is ""forcing"" bundles on me while silently raising my bill",6/23/2015,11:20:15 AM,Internet,Cambridge,Massachusetts,2138,Solved,No,"I signed up with Comcast, my only choice for high speed internet required to do my job as a web developer upon moving to our new apartment in Cambridge, MA. My previous provider Verizon Fios was sadly not available and had far superior services in Arlington, MA.
 They offered an introductory bundle including TV cable services with HD and HBO bundled with their Blast! internet package ($60) which meets my needs for working from home and on-call. We haven't used the cable box for more than a few hours in the 3 years we've had the plan and it sits unplugged so that it's not wasting power. We use online services to watch any TV and movies we need, including HBO Go included with our subscription.
 After the introductory period ended, we saw no reason to continue paying for a service we don't use that sits unplugged and attempted to remove the cable TV service from our plan. I was told that we would have to cancel service entirely to retain just internet and that the price would be HIGHER for less services (just Internet) but the rep offered to give me a discount on my bill.
 Over the past year, Comcast has raised my bill from $80 to now over $100 without any notification or apparent reasoning as the bill doesn't state why their service prices keep going up. Internet alone would cost me up to $90 according to their representative and they offer no way to cancel online, only via phone and via a separate number you can only get by calling or contacting them first.
 I'd love to switch providers, or even have the opportunity to switch but there are no other providers in my area (unlike my electricity, gas utilities...) so Comcast is free to do whatever they want to my bill and service which due to my job I cannot work and earn a living without. This is an inexcusable state that we live in where companies can exist with an effective monopoly and use their pricing power to boost their numbers for the TV services just so I can have access to internet.
 The only way this has been somewhat tolerable is playing mind games with their support staff to get ""retention"" benefits which is a pointless and time wasting endeavor. NO ONE I know pays the same price for the same service as Comcast uses price to manipulate retention and customer service ratings.

365561,Comcast price,6/25/2015,2:38:54 PM,Internet,Cambridge,Massachusetts,2139,Solved,No,"I recently canceled my cable because I only want internet service. At the time I was offered a bundle that included cable HBO and other channels that I do not want or need. The price for this package was $54.99 a month for 12 months after which the price would naturally increase. I should mention that I live in a community that has no other high speed service options so now I pay $72 dollars a month for high speed internet. I feel this is to high a price considering that Comcast will lower my bill if I take other services that will in time go up in price and land me back in a situation where I am paying for cable that I don't watch. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

 Please see the email string below. Comcast is demanding I pay a $535,000 fee in order to fulfill my order for 25Mbs Internet service. I believe requesting such a large sum in order to fulfill the order is in violation of Title II of the Communications Act and specifically Section 254(b)(3) requiring Internet Service Providers to provide access to advanced telecommunications in all regions of the nation at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas.
 Additionally, this fee demand violates Section 202(a) of the Communications Act insofar as it is an unjust, unreasonable and discriminatory charge in order to effect a common carrier communications connection per Section 202(b).
 I appreciate the FCC's prompt response to this complaint. (b) (6)

315997,Hidden Product Installation Fee,5/31/2015,8:27:53 PM,Internet,Camp Hill,Pennsylvania,17011,Solved,No,"When I open my account with Comcast, their agent told me there is no Product Installation Fee/
 activation fee, I just need to pay the monthly fee $39.99. However, in the second/third month, they
 tried to charge my $33.20 installation fee, without any explanation. I contacted with Comcast
 customer service several times, at beginning there was no one told me anything about this fee, I felt
 that their agents are not aware of this fee neither. Finally, an agent explained my that I was charged
 for this installation fee, however this fee is not shown anywhere on their website, or their agent did
 not tell me I would be charged for this neither. I think they really should refund me that. I attached one
 of the chatting transcripts for your reference."
354888,2 months and Comcast has not fixed problem,6/21/2015,8:57:27 PM,Internet,Cane Ridge,Tennessee,37013,Solved,No,"About 2 months ago, intermittent Internet (and phone) outages became very frequent and were lasting up to a week. I was without service about 50% of the time. After multiple phone calls and two visits, Internet service was restored but they changed settings and my wireless router ceased to work. They replaced it with theirs, then replaced that with a new Comcast modem/router, but download speeds remain below 1 or 2 Mbps on all of my devices, except the TV which downloads at around 200 kb/s which equals about 1.6 Mbps. I have a wireless desktop, laptop, iPad, and work laptop, and have not been able to use them for anything more than checking email for two months. I have wasted days on the phone and waiting at home for visits with no results. The most recent visit that I waited for today was supposed to be between 3pm and 5pm. Instead, I got a phone call from the tech at 5 which lasted for 2 1/2 hours. He claimed he had not come to the house because he did not want Comcast to charge me for a service call. He asked stupid questions, and never seemed to understand the problem. Now I have another appointment for tomorrow morning for another service tech to come. Another morning wasted when I can't work.

322409,FCC Complaint against comcast/xfinity on providing false information.,6/3/2015,10:20:53 PM,Internet,Canonsburg,Pennsylvania,15317,Solved,No,"I have attempted to work with Xfinity to get my balance under control . I was told there was nothing they could do to help me. I was informed via an online chat that I could set up a payment plan. I had called the provided number and they simply told me I had to pay my full balance as it was all due then in order to have my service on. I reluctantly agreed to it. The Payment date of 06/03/2015 comes around and I have a $105 charge placed on my account from comcast. They state no charge exists in their system and it was not applied to my account and the additional FULL payment of $335.65 was still going to withdraw from my bank account. It was suggested I should contact my bank to remove the comcast payment, in which they would also block any incoming comcast payments on this day.
 then the rep online notified me that's an entire balance. Not just the past due balance. Why would i be told the balance in full if required, when it isnt all due. the rep i spoke with on the phone stated it all needed to be paid as if it was all past due. As of now I am still trying to speak with someone to hold my account on comcast, as i was on hold on their phone lines for over an hour until it told me then just closed and to call back tomorrow. Tomorrow will mean my rent check bounces and im evicted.
 I have absolutely never in my life been so lied to by a company. I recently am getting over a divorce and comcast is the ONLY one that basically said we dont care, not working with you. I do need this as my main line of communication with work. I sincerely hope this can be resolved, as they are quite reluctant to actually do anything to be such a great company. They are the only true high speed carrier in my area and they absolutely know it.

300123,Comcast internet,5/20/2015,5:47:44 PM,Internet,Canton,Georgia,30114,Open,No,"I am paying for what Comcast claims is the highest internet speed to our home. However, when
 checked periodically internet speeds have never exceeded 20 Mb/s on the download and the upload
 is ever worse. Despite them claiming it is supposed to be around 50 Mb. Plus latency is high
 sometimes as much as a minute or two. Refer to attached copy of Xfinity letter asking me to
 exchange their old cable modem for a new one at ""no additional cost"". This occurred primarily after
 Comcast requested to installed the newest technology in cable modems and sent it to me for
 installation; it didn't work and then another one was installed by their own technician. Nobody ever
 mentioned in writing or verbally that Comcast had a new policy to limit total data usage to 300 Mbytes
 per month which they are now claiming we have to paid extra for. So, we get higher latency, slower
 speeds after 12 years of using the same old modem and have to pay more. Why? I have protested
 about their technical issues since the new modem was installed because it doesn't work well.
 Suddenly after installation, I started getting calls from Comcast's Security Customer Services
 indicating that I was about to meet the maximum data usage and will have to pay more. After several
 calls, nobody has ever indicated there was a limit of 300 Gbytes per month except this afternoon.
 This is a new contractual issue and a misrepresentation on the part of Comcast which was never
 approved by me verbally or in writing. When called in the past, they even told me to disregard the
 calls and not to worry about it.
 I am reporting this to the FCC as it MUST be looked into by your department because it is most likely
 being used in millions of other unsuspecting Comcast/Xfinity customers and households.
 FYI, I was using an old cable modem for over 12 years and Comcast sent me a letter asking me to
 change (see attached) it, claiming it was at no additional cost, for a new cable modem/router, which I
 later found out it also was broadcasting an Xfinity hot spot right from my house without my
 permission. The company claims to have now hundreds of thousands of internet hot spots, of which
 my cable modem, is one. This was NEVER authorized by me and I finally had it disable which the
 company conveniently forgot to tell me it was there to start with. I only found out about it when after
 complaining my speeds and latency have gone up and internet service is worse now than ever, their
 representative said that disabling their Xfinity hot spot would probably help and if it some after I was
 able to disable it.
 FCC, you must do something about these companies which continue to add charges without impunity
 and using lies and half-truths to charge more money to innocent customers which trust them in good
 faith. I have to watch their bills like a hawk because every other month or so they add items and costs
 which are not authorized by me.

 Follow-up message on 6/12/2015 4:50:12 PM:
 Dear FCC or Zendesk, whoever you are:
 Well, not surprised, I will see what Comcast has to say when their written note is received.
 What you are effectively telling me is that the FCC simply acts as a ""mail messenger"" or say a ""mail
 intermediary"" and does not evaluate whether the veracity, accuracy or legitimacy of Comcast's reply
 has any merit? By the same token, did you assess the veracity or accuracy of my complain or simply
 passed it on to Comcast? Probably, the latter is what you did. And then left it up to Comcast to offer a
 ""reply"" to me, which the FCC neither assessed nor investigated? Am I mistaken?
 I will reserve my judgment until their reply is received but it seems rather useless at this point. The
 agency the government has created to protect the consumer and ensure there is no abuse is merely,
 in this case, a ""pass-through"" non-entity. In other words, since the great majority of the population has
 no idea of your regulations and laws regarding telecommunication licenses, etc., you simply assume
 once Comcast or any company answers the problem (by definition) is resolved and closed. It seems
 to me you are being somewhat biblical and ""washing your hands"" out of this issue, without assessing
 if there was any validity to my complain or Comcast's answer. However, if my conclusion is incorrect,
 please do let me know ASAP.
 BTW, according to licensing arrangements, Comcast is apparently the only one authorized (a
 monopoly) to provide cable services in our county (other than satellite or an antenna for local
 stations) and I have no other options or recourse. I am curious to know, did Comcast showed you a
 signed copy of the contract or something which confirmed I agreed to this ""new"" internet service
 provision? Did you do any investigation? Have you investigated if the FCC received any other
 complains similar to mine? My guess is probably not. Correct? The FCC simply took Comcast's word
 and closed the complain. Is that it?
 Respectfully,

321463,Comcast Usage Caps,6/3/2015,3:36:13 PM,Internet,Canton,Georgia,30115,Solved,No,"I am in the Atlanta market. However, I'm far enough away from Atlanta that I only have one option for broadband Internet, and that's Comcast. In fact, I only have one other option, slower than the FCC's definition of broadband, for any Internet access at all.
 I'm in what Comcast calls a ""test market"" for its capped broadband Internet. They do not offer uncapped residential plans, so this is my only choice for Internet. They offer me a good speed (50mbps), but the cap is only 300GB per month. That means they only allow me to use that connection for the equivalent of 13 hours and 40 minutes each month, or a little under 2% of the month.
 The vast majority of my internet usage is streaming video: My wife and I follow baseball on MLB.TV (go Cards!), my sister in law lives with us and watches TV shows on Netflix during the day when she's not working, and another of their sisters is living with us for the summer and watching anime shows on Netflix after doing her summer school work.
 The Cardinals regularly play 25 games per month. At about 3 hours per game and, as MLB.TV advises, around 3mbps for the highest video quality (which they don't allow me to lower manually on the platform we use to stream it), each game is around 4 GB. That's 100 GB per month if we only watch the Cardinals games.
 Netflix runs about 3 GB per hour for HD video, which much of their content is. So if my sisters in law watch an average of 3 hours per day of Netflix content, they're blasting through another 270 GB. Even if they limit it to 2 hours that only leaves me with 20 GB of data to use for non-streaming Internet.
 If I buy one game in a month through GOG.com, Steam, Origin, or the PlayStation Store and have to download it, I'm over my quota and am automatically billed for my overage. An overage that, I have to point out, costs Comcast marginally nothing.
 That's what 300GB looks like for a modern family. And Comcast is penalizing us for getting our entertainment through means it can't compete with.
 I urge the FCC to take action against Comcast and protect the open and useful Internet I grew up with. I fear I won't recognize it if nobody holds companies like Comcast accountable.

360511,Data Caps and the Extortion Methods of Comcast,6/23/2015,11:22:33 PM,Internet,Canton,Georgia,30114,Solved,Yes,"The area where I have internet service (metro-Atlanta) has a data cap that was put in place in 2013 for 300GB. Comcast is imposing this data cap in a market where there are no other viable competitors available. Thus, Comcast's actions are that of a monopoly and ultimately extortion.
 They are punishing and taxing us for data that we already pay for. For individuals that go over their monthly allotment, Comcast changes an additional $10 for 50GB. However, if you pay an additional $10, you get a plan that doubles the amount to 600GB. In a sense, Comcast is stating ""pay us more, and we'll stop charging you for data that wouldn't have charged additionally beforehand anyways"".
 These deployments are selective to areas that Comcast has a major hold on the market. Data caps are nothing but a inhibitor to creativity, enjoyment, and ultimately productivity of the American people. Comcast has imposed these fees and restrictions on our usage for the sole reason that they are future proofing their current market structure.
 Internet Service Providers understand that cable television is outdated, and more and more households are going to streaming services strictly. The data caps are a massive restriction that will hamper our ability to use the internet as it was intended.

Yet, we incurred $10 Speed Boost charges after first month of using only 90% of 500GB. The speed boost charge is actually for data and this is deceiving to call it ""speed"". Secondly we incurred charges during the ""curtsey"" months. Monthly rate for modem lease jumped from $7 to $10 and it's the same equipment we've had for several years. Why should we pay more without being notified for equipment that's the same, not newer?

I was presented and agreed to a 2 year contract for the XF starter triple play bundle with an incentive of a $300 Visa gift card. A couple months later I called customer service regarding the gift card, as I had not received it, and I was told my account had to have 3 months if good standing before it would be processed (I was in good standing), and to check a gift card website for updates on when to expect it. I checked, and there was no record of me. Checked later, same. Well, life happened and I forgot about it until having to contract customer service recently for another issue. I was directed to an email, we_can_help@cable.comcast.com, for help. I wrote an email describing the situation, and received a call from Barbara, apparently an executive customer service agent (phone number 888-966-7794 x3014459) looking to resolve the issue. I was told, in so many words, I am a liar. There is no record of my accepting that incentive after reviewing my history. I would have had to call and have a verbal agreement for the gift card. Nothing of the sort was ever asked or explained to me when I had ordered from the agent. She then informs me that they didn't even put me on contract, I was signed up for a completely different promotion. She also let me know that I should have known that if I looked through all my paperwork I got after my agent to sign up that I didn't get the incentive, because, ""that's what I would have done."" Insulting my abilities as a consumer. She informed me that she's sorry but there's nothing that can be done because there is no record of anything abs they can't check with the agents for transcripts of the initial correspondence with the agent where I agreed to the contract because they don't keep them in file, and even suggested I should have kept that transcript myself. I trusted blindly, I guess. Well, it's a bait and switch regardless.

 Follow-up message by Consumer on 7/28/2015 1:09:45 PM:
 Thank you for your assistance with my complaint #363169. I received the copy of Comcast's answer to your inquiry and have found their account of our interaction to be inaccurate. I wish to clarify my concerns and restate that my assertion that Comcast manipulates prices and performance. Despite their indication otherwise, my complaint remains unresolved. (b) (6)
 Comcast wrote to the FCC that I requested a promotional offer; I did not. I requested fair pricing for a la carte Internet service, whereby the price for standalone high speed internet service is less than equivalent Internet service that is bundled with cable television and landline telephone service. Comcast continues to manipulate Internet pricing in an effort to bolster its subscriptions to Cable Television, most likely in an effort to artificially improve its advertising viewership claims. Comcast's offer to discount my Internet subscription for one year does lower my price, however this temporary accommodation in no way alleviates nor addresses the actual issue of unfair price manipulation to the masses who have not complained to the FCC.
 Secondly, Comcast indicates that it provided a courtesy credit to my account to remunerate me for making multiple calls to their customer service line. This $180 credit was requested by me for a different reason. It is a partial reimbursement for overcharges for the past 24 months whereby Comcast charged me for high speed Internet service of 75mbs or higher, yet provided service of substantially inferior speeds (due to poorly maintained equipment in my neighborhood). Comcast has repaired their cables and their promised service delivery standards are now being met. Comcast did not offer the partial reimbursement for over charges, rather it provided the credit only upon my insistence.
 Regards, (b) (6)"
236498,Complaint against Comcast,4/15/2015,10:26:22 AM,Internet,Carmichael,California,95609,Closed,No,"I have been having problems with Comcast in billing issues.
 The problem is Comcast when opening a new account by default sets the account to ECO Billing without informing its customers. The customer has to remove a small dot from web page in order to receive a paper bill for services ordered.
 Additionally, Comcast does not inform the customer when the billing cycle is and never notifies the customer that the bill is available and where it can look at.
 In fact I never even had access to the Comcast web page do problems with Comcast log in for some 6 months.
 I have been trying to figure out past billing do to Comcast imposing late fee billing, which Comcast refuses to address.
 It has taken me some 12 months to get off of ECO Billing and that only happen because I had to call the CEO Office of Comcast and that took some 8 calls before it was done.
 I still have not received any of the past bills and just how the late fees were calculated.
 Comcast also during this time frame I paid for services that I did not received and also billed for services that they did not disclosed and I contested these facts and they did give some adjustments

263893,Comcast Data usage meter,4/29/2015,12:20:31 PM,Internet,Cartersville,Georgia,30120,Closed,No,"I believe Comcast is unfairly inflating their customers' internet usage and charging them overages that aren't actually occurring. I have seen my internet usage in Georgia approach the 'cap' every month and started noticing that the internet meter was still climbing (both on Comcast's website and the desktop app) even when all of the computers in the house were turned off while we have been out of town.
 This made me curious and I have done a few experiments in the past few weeks. I completely disconnected my Comcast cable modem from both the incoming cable and the power outlet, so the modem is completely turned off and no possibility of data usage should occur. I did this for a week. I made a note of the internet usage reported the next day from work (to make sure that the meter had completely updated). I then checked it a week later, and it had reported that I had used 28 GB of data. This is not possible. I did the same experiment a few weeks later, and it showed a usage of 19 GB. How is this physically possible? Comcast either has a major problem with their metering or they are intentionally inflating usage to cause charges for exceeding the cap.
 I have started looking at some of the forums online and am finding that other users are experiencing similar issues.
 Comcast should be investigated on this issue immediately. There is no actual justification for the data cap other than to take advantage of people's ignorance to how the internet works.
 I don't wish to give my full information at this time as I fear Comcast will harass me for reporting this.

I was told that if I upgraded my internet speeds to the ""extreme 105"" plan, I would be given double the usual 300gb/month limit, 600gb/month. I agreed to this plan, and got the corresponding monthly charge increase. Comcast has since denied any knowledge of this conversation, and claims that it isn't possible for me to receive this data increase and I must be misunderstood about what the previous representative claimed. I know for a fact that I am not mistaken, because I made sure to confirm this claim with multiple representatives before I agreed to the monthly cost increase. Now, I am stuck with extremely fast internet access, but the same data cap I was willing to pay to avoid. I was lied to by multiple representatives of Comcast, but they know they are my only option and they do not care if I am unsatisfied with their service. they have a monopoly on high speed access in my area and they are abusing their power.

I asked if there were any additional fees and the agent said no.
 I couldn't see the details of my new plan until nearly a month later when the next billing cycle started. I discovered that Comcast was charging me $70 a month for this new package, with $8 in fees and taxes that they are required to offer.

279279,Comcast Cable connection from street is underwater and structure is too high,5/7/2015,7:52:46 PM,Internet,Castro Valley,California,94552,Open,Yes,"Several months ago I called Comcast because Internet connection fails, downloads are slow and
 sometimes the TV does not receive a signal. The Representative told me that the problem was on my
 end due to a faulty connection. I investigated and eventually opened the concrete box where the
 Comcast connection comes in from near the sidewalk in front of my house. The cable inside this
 concrete box comes out of a tube which is an inch or so in diameter. This tube is full of water. Where
 the two cables go into another tube the end is covered in mud. See attached photo. I speculate that
 this could be an issue of the faulty connection on my end. Also, this concrete box is 5 inches tall and
 has presented a tripping hazard. I have contacted Comcast six times now asking for resolution of
 these issues. I started using Comcast's chat session so that I could keep record of the contacts. Each
 time I contact Comcast ensures me that a technician will come out within a few days or within 24
 hours. The last chat session with Comcast was last night and the chat session was terminated
 because of poor Internet connection. No technician has come out to even look at this issue.

319702,West Coast Service Issues - Comcast,6/2/2015,6:29:16 PM,Internet,Cazadero,California,95421,Solved,No,"On 6/1/15, broadband service became extremely irregular ie. slowdown, loss of signal, back up at reduced speeds, down again, etc. After rebooting my router and modem several time I finally felt it was time to contact the customer support group at Comcast, my provider. I called 611 (I am a Comcast Phone subscriber and that is the best way to reach them) and immediately was disconnected. I called again and received a voice message stating ""No one was available at the moment"" and to ""Call back later"". Out of frustration I called 00 on my phone to reach a Comcast operator - after waiting for 3 minutes an operator came on line and immediately asked if I was calling regarding my broadband service disruption. I replied ""Yes"" and after I reviewed what happened when trying to contact Customer Service, she stated ""Customer Service has turned off their system as they feel they are overloaded with calls"". My reply, ""yeah, that's great Customer Service""! Amazingly the phone operator agreed with me. She courteously went on to say the outage was extensive covering most if not all of CA an perhaps other Western States. I thanked her for her courtesy and taking the time to share with me the service issue.
 Thank you for not allowing the Comcast/OTW merger to go through. It is bad enough dealing with Comcast and OTW individually - Imagine what a disaster it would have been as a merged monopoly.

369455,Comcast refuses to uhold contract for 2 years phone/internet,6/26/2015,10:22:21 PM,Internet,Cazadero,California,95421,Pending,No,"First Comcast disconnected my internet/phone without authorization , this occurred during a move. We were still charged a early termination fee of $90. As attempt to remedy the unlawful disconnect the original 2 year contract for a fixed rate of 39.99 for phone/internet services special was offered and contracted into at the new address. I was given a self install kit which turned out to be in non working condition. I spent at least 40 hours attempting to get service with Comcast employees on this faulty box. Finally a Technician who knew what they were doing was able to determine the box not working. I was asked to return box (an 3 hour commute) when I was given a new box but while attempting to get services, I was informed that unless I paid 60.00 dollars for an alleged bill form somewhere in the past that I had no prior knowledge of I could not get services on. This was going on 6 weeks of daily attempts to initiate service so I was forced to pay the amount without researching the validity of charge. A family member has a medical condition which emergency services have been needed and could not risk being without a phone any longer. The new box and the alleged 60.00 charge changed the account number twice. Both times I was assured by every Comcast employee that I spoke with that the 2 year fixed rate of 39.99 was still in effect.
 I received a call from on the the Comcast employees who attempted to trick me into contracting into a different service agreement with service fees that were incrementally raised every 6 months. I CLEARLY DECLINED THIS OFFER why would I enter into a contract that was not as good as the one that I had with Comcast. f It was beginning to appear as if Comcast was attempting to break the 2 year fixed rate of 39.99 contract by whatever means possible. Comcast monthly fee are paid by automatic withdraw from a account that a Payee of mine pays. She had been unable to resolve the escalating fee indicated that Comcast was not upholding the contract with me. In a trip another 3 hour commute I spoke with the Comcast employee who instituted the 2 year 39.99 month rate. HE remembered the original agreement and states the issue would be rectified in 3 days and gave me a Confirmation number reflecting such. This was after many more hours spent by me on this issue including long chart with a Supervisor who stated I just needed to go to the local office. The bill was never adjusted. The Supervisor at the local office does not respond to my emails as promised more time spent on this issue. The bill has now escalated so high that the Comcast employees have actually said I'm being ripped off for the services I'm getting. I now not only want amends with bill adjusted retroactively to reflect the contracted amount of 39.99 for 2 years and reimbursement for the overcharging but to be compensated for the extreme amount of hours spent on this issue.

362901,Comcast business internet is much more expensive that home internet.,6/24/2015,5:16:41 PM,Internet,Centennial,Colorado,80112,Solved,No,"Comcast's justification for business pricing is that the service is bundled with a bunch of tools that we do not, and never will use (and are generally useless). We requested that we have home internet at our business, but they say that is not possible. In addition to this, Comcast will lower home internet prices even more if you threaten to cancel every year, which itself is a shady practice. The result is that business internet is about three times more expensive for the exact same home service. If there were real competition, we would not face this issue, and pricing would be more reasonable.

 Christine Nussbaum from Comcast contacted me regarding this complaint.
 My complaint is that Comcast charges nearly twice as much for commercial bandwidth as it does for residential bandwidth, and that there is no difference between the commercial and residential product.
 Christine noted that is was only Comcast internal policy that dictated this pricing.
 Their justification for the commercial pricing is that the building is zoned commercial, and that is how their pricing works. The only difference that she could state between the commercial and residential service is that if there were to be a service call, that they would address it right away.
 I noted that there is no competition in our area that has the bandwidth we need for our business. Comcast is our only option.
 Christine stated that there is competition from Century Link. I explained that they cannot provide the bandwidth we need. She insisted that the amount of bandwidth is irrelevant, and that Century Link is indeed competition.
 The only conclusion that a reasonable person could reach is that Comcast knows that there is no competition at that bandwidth, and so they have decided to price gouge.
 Thank you for your consideration.

293621,Comcast Corporation Data Caps,5/16/2015,6:49:41 PM,Internet,Chamblee,Georgia,30341,Solved,No,"Greetings good people of the FCC, my name is and I am filing a complaint in regard to
 Comcast's imposing of data caps on users not only in the Atlanta area, but nationwide. In this widely
 connected digital age, a consistent availability of online service is a cornerstone of American life. That
 aside, it is simply outrageous that paid for residential services in particular have data caps. Many
 people have families, multiple using online devices and services at a time. This quickly consumes
 data, and it is detrimental to consumer relations that such data caps exist, as they clearly do not take
 this into any regard.
 Atlanta is one of the largest metro areas in the country, and it is simply absurd for data caps to exist
 in significant area of the United States. Additionally, it is an exploitative measure I feel, in order to
 undermine alternatives to traditional TV services such as Netflix, and discourage consumers that pay
 for their internet service to pursue such means of entertainment. It is not at all indicative of keeping up
 with the current technologies and services of 2015 and beyond. Everything is connected: game
 consoles, phones, televisions, and even watches. This trend will only magnify in the coming years.
 Data caps are stifling to the current needs and the future potential of such matters.
 With innovative streaming services such as Netflix, Youtube, and Amazon, and many channels
 themselves offering streaming of their own content through online services, there are individuals like
 myself that wish to get their entertainment through the use of such services as opposed to traditional
 TV. Comcast is intentionally trying to stifle such competition I feel through the data caps. Not only do
 I find this unethical, I feel it should be illegal. I do hope the good people at the FCC do take an active
 interest and effort to combat these data caps, as they have no place in a technologically advanced
 society like the United States.
 Please strongly take my words into consideration and thank you for your time.
 Sincerely,"

Initially, the first technician claims that it was my splitter that was causing the connectivity issue. After a week, the problem persist so I called the customer service to report the recurring incident. They say they will send out a ""senior technician"" to take a look. Finally, the technician said there was an issue with the line connection out by the street where it runs a line to my house. He fixed the issue and the company billed me for the repair. In my opinion, this is a infrastructure repair cost and the customer is not responsible for the repair cost. As a customer, I pay a monthly subscription fee to have a working internet and should not be responsible for upkeep of their infrastructure to provide that service for me. In addition, not to mention the terrible customer service from their call center. I was told that they will investigate my issue and give a call in return. Two weeks later and there was still no call so I followed up. Not only I was told that the company does not give call back to their customers and that my billing concern was resolved. So in conclusion, I was deceived and lied to by customer service representative and I was unethically charged for a service to fix their infrastructure to provide me with internet service that I should have with my monthly subscriptions.

327188,Comcast Data Cap,6/6/2015,11:01:47 PM,Internet,Charleston,South Carolina,29414,Solved,No,"I would like to bring to your attention, as I am sure many have done before, the terrible practice of Comcast instituting data caps of 300gb. I happen to be in one of their test cities, and I can tell you that the data cap limit they want to eventually bring nation wide, is not only anti consumer, but spits in the face of Net Neutrality. I don't have tons of options as far as ISP's go, so Comcast is what I'm stuck with. So much of the modern daily life is spent utilizing the internet, it almost seems impossible to live without it. Putting a cap on the amount of data we are allowed to use is allowing Comcast to tell us how we need to live our lives. People who do a lot of work at home, and are constantly downloading, uploading and transferring files, making video calls and even working online. Damn near everyone consumed digital media, whether it be on a PC, smartphone or tablet. Watching videos, playing games, keeping in touch with the rest of the world. Why should Comcast have the power to dictate how what I can do and when? Data caps have been and will continue to be a disruptions in the every day lives of consumers everywhere. I can't even sit down and enjoy a movie via Netflix in my free-time without the fear that it might take up precious bandwidth. Data caps are, in a word, bullshit. I hope that you all at the FCC are able to see what a terrible precedent data caps would be. Companies being paid for the usage of bandwidth is one thing, but placing arbitrary limits on ones usage and charging overage fees is a clear example of milking the consumer for all they have. Please help stop the caps.

327649,Comcast wrongfully autodrafted a final bill that was not yet adjusted,6/7/2015,8:27:03 PM,Internet,Charleston,South Carolina,29403,Closed,Yes,"Dear FCC,
 As with previous experience with Comcast, I was not surprised this time around to once again have a problem with them. After arguing my bill going up without notice (almost doubling), I decided to go ahead and cancel my service early as I was moving out anyway. The bill, $76.95, was auto-drafted on 5/30 for service that was set to run May 11th-June 10th. I called Comcast on 5/28 and told them to cancel service on 5/29. So the $76.95 would have been an incorrect amount. Now Comcast tells me that I have to wait 30-45 days for a technician to ""physically disconnect"" service before the adjustment is posted and the credit is give. This is a rental property so I have no idea what a technician needs to do at a property where the new tenants likely have Comcast service already. Additionally, they don't have to come out to activate my service so they shouldn't need to come out to turn it off. This is criminal. They wrongfully took money they knew was incorrect. If this were not routing through my roommates account I would walk down to the bank right now and do a chargeback. I would also like to point out that this was not explained to me when I canceled that this would happen. I was also told that the auto-draft would NOT process because of this. So they lied and took out the wrong amount. Talking with them via live chat seems like there is nothing I can do.
 Sincerely,
 and authorized user on this Comcast account)

Furthermore, it happens to every device in our house including ipads, iphones, macs, and windows computers. Why is it so difficult for comcast to provide internet that is good quality. Also, when we moved into our apartment in August, it took comcast 17 days to finally come out and set up our internet even though I called a month in advance and they assured me that I could set it up my self despite the house never been wired for comcast before. I honestly think we need a new internet box and I tried to telling comcast that but they didn't listen to me. If I could switch to a different provider I would.

359201,Comcast data cap at 300GB,6/23/2015,4:18:01 PM,Internet,Charleston,South Carolina,29405,Pending,No,"Comcast cable is charging me $10 for every 50GB over the 300GB data cap. I pay for the fastest internet service they provide because I want to watch 4k content, which is only available online. I also live with two other people who use the internet for work and entertainment, we go through a lot of data.
 I know what I signed up for from Comcast; I just don't think it is fair to charge for overages without an option to select a plan that has a higher data cap.

362066,Complex situation prevents bundling discounts and drives service price up,6/24/2015,2:10:36 PM,Internet,Charlottesville,Virginia,22901,Solved,No,"I live in a condo/apartment community that has negotiated with Comcast for cable television, so a type of basic cable TV service is included with my rent. When I moved here initially, I was given a promotional rate of $40 for the Performance tier of Internet service. After a year, the price for the service increased to $65, which I take to be the standard price for unbundled cable Internet. I called Comcast and they agreed to reduce the monthly price to $53.
 I've not had any particular problems with the Internet service, but I still feel as if Comcast is using my situation against me. Because the TV is effectively coming to me separately, I can't get a package deal unless I add phone (which I don't need) or premium cable channels (which I also don't need). As a result, I end up paying for Internet as if it were my only service. However, since the cable connection to my unit has to be on because of the agreement with the HOA, it is hard for me to see how the marginal increase in service by adding Internet is costing Comcast $53/month. I have my own equipment (both modem and router) as well, so the $53/month seems to be merely for the (modest) Internet speeds I get. Like many users, I find Comcast's added services (e.g. email) extraneous, and probably the only service I even monthly is streaming live TV online (which actually requires the TV package and not merely the Internet).
 I don't have much negotiating power with Comcast because the alternative ISP is a mediocre DSL connection through the local phone company. Since the cable service to my unit is negotiated through the HOA, it's hard to imagine how there will be any serious competition in my complex anytime soon. A company in the area is working on building out a fiber network, but I expect it to be a long time before they are even close to my place.
 In addition, about a year ago, Comcast began encrypting their cable TV signal to my unit. I had to appeal to current FCC rules regarding encryption in order to maintain the HD signal for local channels. I now have two cable boxes attached to the same TV--the standard set top, and the HD decrypter--in order to keep the level of service that I had when I moved in. Comcast wants $20/month more to combine these two into a single HD cable box.
 In sum, Comcast is my only serious option, and they appear to know that and have benefited from my weak negotiating position.

Comcast Charge me for equipment that was never installed by the technician. For the past 4 to 5 months I've been calling multiple times a month to get reimbursed for the 250 dollars they charged me. The Over charge I've recieved was from Home Security and everytime I've called I get told that I need to talk to somone in Home security but whenever I do they tell me that there is a Note in the system saying the amount that needs to be reimbursed and waiting on manager approval do to the amount and the next billing cycle it should take affect. Every month I have my service disconencted due to chargers that was an error from Comcast, every month I've been having to pay reconnection fees and when I talk to a representative they tell me the same thing and I never get the reimbursent. This past Monday I had my service disconnected yet again the day before an importan exam I was taking the cost me 600 dollars. Instead of studying I spent atleast 3 or 4 hours dealing with comcast to try and fix this issue which lead to me failing. The following day after spending hours with a representative I was told that everything was taking care of and my service was brought back up, then again the my service was disconnected. I am beyond frustrated and If it wasn't for the fact that I don't really have a choice for another service provider I would have left comcast. Everytime I've tried to talk to a manager I've not been able to, no paying customer should go through what I have gone through and even still have the same issue.

234266,Comcast Hard Inquiries,4/14/2015,11:40:15 AM,Internet,Chester,Virginia,23831,Closed,No,"Last year I moved to Indiana, and when I had Comcast Internet setup, they asked to check my credit. I allowed this, as I did not realize it would be a hard inquiry and could affect my credit. The job in Indiana did not work out, and I moved back to Virginia, and set up Comcast Internet there. This resulted in another hard inquiry. This has affected my credit, such as the deposit amount required when I moved to my new apartment. I feel Comcast should not be allowed to place a hard inquiry to set up Internet service for a customer. If this cannot be changed, they should at least have to explain in more detail how it can affect your credit. If I was aware of this, I would have asked about other options.

 the speed that is comming into the system (at the actual computer) utilizing 2Wire.com and the
 reading was 2.5mb. We are paying for 25mb. Comcast will direct their customers to their site to
 perform the speed test to get a false result.
 a few weeks ago Comcast did send the technician to our home to address the many complaints that
 we are having with their service. They charged me $40 for the 2 visits to fix the problem that THEY
 are having with the service. they said the problem was my Modem. They installed their modem

 visit to fix a problem that they are having with their system.

We moved and set up everything on June 2nd, called the activation line and after 2 hours was told our internet box was the wrong one for our area. They gave us an address for a office near our new home and business hours. We drive there and the office has moved 10 miles further than the address given to us. Which isn't a big deal but, the customer line should have known since that location has been open since March... We get there and everything seems fine EXCEPT, the customer service line has put in an order for a self install kit to be mailed to us...after we were told to drive to the location. We call to have the kit canceled so we could just pick it up while we are there. It takes 3 calls for someone to actually pick up the phone after the automated system (all we could hear is talking in the background). The representative (that didn't disclose her name) said that they couldn't cancel the order since, she would have to start over completely if she did. Mark (the rep at the xfinity store) ended up speaking to her, he tried to explain the situation and she still denied help. Supervisors got involved at this point (they were very quite about what transpired) after about 30 mins we left with new equipment to be installed at home. We bring the equipment home and begin the installation, the Internet doesn't connect after 20 mins. We call back speak to a tech, she does everything she can and then tells us our home is not set up for Comcast! She sets up for a tech to come out, the tech will not be here until the 11th! We are now going into 2 weeks with a service that I think we over pay for. This has been one of the most stressful moving experiences of our lives. It seems like they don't care if they loose our business, I just hope that someone does something about this company's level of care for their customer. We will be sending out warnings to every customer we come across and hope that they finally realize how much they actually impact already stressful situations. The only good thing I can say about this company is that the Hull St location in Chesterfield, Va was fantastic.

232709,Comcast Service and Customer service issues,4/13/2015,3:41:50 PM,Internet,Chicago,Illinois,60647,Closed,No,"Hello,
 After being a Comcast customer for over 7 years I am finished. Watching my bill steadily climb as rapidly as the percentage of network downtime, and receiving no solution after numerous repair visits and several where no one ever bothered to show up.
 Having a home based business, I couldn't deal with the 4-12 hour internet outages which were occurring 2-3 times a month last year on the Residential side last year, so, in February I switched to Comcast business services with promises of better support and uptime which ACTUALLY appears to be true. The salesman also assured me my bill would be very close to my current Residential price, but alas, my new bill is apparently $537.67 for Business class phone and internet and an additional $242.26 for television from the Residential side. Starting at the $99.00 Triple Play bundle, I'd say that's a pretty impressive price increase curve. After some investigation, It seemed like a simple mix-up, Residential never was informed of the switch, so had continued to pay my monthly $242.00 bill, and now the Business side wants me to pay for the last three months of service all at once (Yes, the same three months I've already paid through my triple play package), but apparently none of the employees at either Comcast Residential or Business Services can figure things out.
 Over the past 3 months, I have spent over 26 hours on the phone with over 20 Comcast employees (9 just today) trying to explain the billing mistake, as well as correct service problems after the initial switch to Business Class. Comcast is not willing to refund anything at this time, even the 10 minutes of on-site installation which was billed at $49.00 and switch fee of $99.00 which resulted in no internet or phone service for 4 days.
 Today, after 4 hours on the phone, I was finally guaranteed corrections to the billing error by a representative of the Chicago Retention office, but oddly, she couldn't figure out how much of a correction, or what my combined monthly bills will be after the fix. She also could not provide me with an incident number, account number for my Business service (which nobody seems to have), or any single person or department to follow up with once the corrections were made.
 Sincerely,
 .

A year ago I retired and closed the office when I turned 75. I moved the fast service to my home. I am now moving out of state so I requested the service be shut off. Comcast said when the service was moved, a new contract started and I have to pay a $2,300 early termination fee. In the contract they were giving me a $10 discount from $109 to $99 monthly which explains the termination fee. A company engaging in a shameless grift. Truly pathetic. Elizabeth Warren is right.

 The shop closed, and I personally took the equipment back to the Comcast building, once there I asked if there was any other money that I owed to make sure things would close smoothly on March 14th. The person behind the counter told me she had no shut off for me on March 14th. I went out to the parking lot and called the comcast 800 number to find out what was going on. They told me they did not have any shut off for my account. Then assured me once again that it must be some type of internal mistake and it would be closed on March 14th. At that time I had received what I thought would be my last comcast bill before closing. I asked if I should pay it and they told me no, just to wait until I receive the final bill and settle it all then. I waited.
 At the end of February beginning on March I upgraded my personal Comcast account and had more equipment I had to return. I also received a bill from comcast which I thought was my final bill. But the bill also had a $20.00 late charge on it. I returned my personal equipment and called Comcast to complain about the late charge. They once again said they did not have the shut off on the books but it must be an internal mistake they will make sure all is shut off by March 14th. They also at that time waived the $20.00 late charge and told me I should pay the bill pending. I went back into the building and paid the bill.
 I thought was was done with until I opened my e mail on April 12th, that told me I was pass due on my account and owed $300.00!!!! I once again telephoned Comcast to be told that no one ever received a disconnect order but they would put it in right away so that the disconnection would happen on April 13th and a supervisor would call me back to discuss the $300.00 bill I refuse to pay. Once again I stayed on the line, once again the young lady assured me that she received the disconnect document and it will all be done by tomorrow April 14th.
 Once again I called on April 14th to make sure this was all done with, once again the same story, they never received the document. Once again filled it out , once again waited until until the person on the other line received it, but this time I received a confirmation that it was received. And now he is telling me it will take 60 days to complete and I am to pay for these services. Once again a supervisor was to call back.
 I called again today, was told it was not disconnected as of yet, was once again told a supervisor will call back, I am not holding my breath.
 I need this madness to stop! Why would I have returned all of the equipment on Feb 4th if I was still using this?
 I have no idea where else to turn. I do not feel I owe them another penny.
 Thank you

214441,COMCAST THROTTLING SPEEDS AND DATA CAPS,4/2/2015,2:20:18 PM,Internet,Chicago,Illinois,60657,Closed,No,"Dear FCC (Tom Wheeler),
 I'd like to start by saying please make the internet a 'Title II'. Comcast's customer service is terrible. I mean I don't really need to give any examples because as I'm sure you're fully aware but they practice fraudulent billing techniques , throttle speeds, and place data caps. In the passed I've had all those things happens. My bill every month went up exponentially which has forced me to cancel with them more than once but I have to keep coming back because they basically hold a monopoly (we need more Antitrust policies) . My area, Chicago doesn't have a 'data cap' or 'data threshold' yet without fail at the end of the my connection speeds suddenly drop drastically. I'm paying for 100mpbs and they give me 5mpbs usually this is because of some sort of data cap and or threshold which was not advertised upon the agreement. I'm not only one who was trouble with this terrible company. I refer to you to the popular website reddit.com. They have a section dedicated to people who have trouble with comcast (http://www.reddit.com/r/Comcast/). Please Mr. Wheeler do something about this company and anyone and everyone who practices fraudulent business practices. It's ridiculous and laughable that we being the United States of America have the worst internet out of all of the first world countries. It's also ridiculous that there are some third world countries who have our same internet speeds or better.

 I am having ongoing trouble connecting wirelessly to the internet. This has been happening for over a year. My internet speed runs slowly even though we have the fastest residential speed through Comcast. Our wifi signal is constantly looking for a signal. Also, our internet connection just bumps us off the internet throughout the day, every day. I would say that it happens more often during the evening hours. We live in a modest sized home, and do not have more than two cell phones, one iPad, and one computer. This issue happens on all of our devices, as well as with the devices brought in by any guests that may be visiting/trying to use our homes wireless connection.

 me through a few basic troublshooting issues and when that didn't work they said they can send a
 workman out to my house. I asked how much that would cost and i was told $40. The workman
 showed up, and did next to nothing. He told us we needed to buy a completely new router, and he
 left, without the problem being fixed. I then decided to simply change the wifi channel that my internet
 was on and that solved the problem. I was charged $70 from Comcast to have a workman come out
 and do absolutely nothing. I am so tired of this company and would sooner get rid of cable all together
 then to continue my service. I feel completely ripped off and devalued as a customer."
278392,Billing Dispute,5/7/2015,2:13:45 PM,Internet,Chicago,Illinois,60608,Solved,No,"Consumer has bundled internet and cable service with Comcast. She is a victim of bait and switch;
 her monthly rate continues to escalate for the same services. She started out with the internet
 essentials at $9.95/mo; her cable has increased from $14.95/mo when she signed on to $59.99/mo.
 When she signed up she was told 2 cable boxes were included free but now sheâ€™s being billed for
 them. Sheâ€™s billed for TV Guide which she never wanted; she asked them to take the charge off, they
 stated they would eliminate the charge but they never did. She wanted to disconnect her cable
 service because she cannot afford these increases. Yesterday, when she called in she had difficulty
 terminating the cable service and today it is still not shut off. As a resolution, the consumer wants the
 $14.99/month cable plan she was originally promised. ***CTR367-phone***"

 Comcast and it was faulty so they came out to replace it and charged me for doing so plus an
 additional fee to set it up. After I complained multiple times they agreed charges were invalid because
 I shouldnt have to pay for faulty equipment and removed them from my account only to charge them
 again. they will not allow me to speak to a manager and shut off my service because I didnt pay the
 extra charges. I had to pay to restart my service. They also say that I signed a work order which I did
 not, but will not provide evidence of this order."
284044,Comcast,5/11/2015,4:27:10 PM,Internet,Chicago,Illinois,60657,Closed,No,"We moved to Chicago in May 2014. We signed a two year contract with Comcast. When we
 switched apartments within the same building, we were told that if we wanted to keep the shows on
 our DVR, we would have to have a service technician come to install the new service. The service
 technician screwed up and we did not get to keep our shows. Comcast made up for this issue with a
 credit after several phone calls. Then, we realized that the old email account we used with the prior
 apartment was not transferred to our new address. I called and it was supposed to be switched.
 When I finally got word that it was, there were no emails. They were all gone. Now, I have to wait
 another 24 hours in hopes that they recover my VERY IMPORTANT emails. In addition, the speed is
 so SLOW. It is faster for us to use our cell service than to use the internet. And they say we have the
 ""Blast"" which is supposed to be very fast. I have never had more problems with a company in all my
 life. How is a company with terrible service and customer service still in business? Oh, because they
 pretty much have a monopoly."
285615,Internet Speeds Not as Advertised,5/12/2015,1:23:23 PM,Internet,Chicago,Illinois,60622,Open,No,"I started a 25mbps internet plan with Comcast Xfinity two months ago, and at the time, I wasn't
 notified that they would throttle my speeds based on my modem. I talked to the rep extensively, and
 this was never mentioned. This is also a modem I've used previously with Comcast and has delivered
 the speeds advertised.
 Flash forward, after two months of DL speeds at 15mbps, I chatted customer service to ask why it
 was so slow. They said that it's because of my DOCSIS 2.0 modem. This particular modem is rated
 up to 38mbps, much more than the 25mbps speeds I'm paying for.
 If this is the case, why doesn't Comcast Xfinity tell consumers before they sign up for a plan?
 Additionally, why can't they deliver speeds they advertise to modems that are more than capable of
 getting that speed?"

 Comcast is not allowing me to use the service on the PlayStation device even though there is the
 HBO Go app available. Other service providers allow access like AT&T, Verizon, Time Warner Cable,
 DirecTV and many others. I believe Comcast is block access to the HBO Go service that I pay for on

 technicians for an hour. Nothing was able to be resolved and I asked for an escalation ticket to be put
 in as the matter was an emergency because I work from home. The tech and his supervisor proceed
 to put in an escalation ticket. They let me know that someone would be calling with an hour with a
 time frame for when I could expect a technician. I never received a phone call from either Comcast
 tech support or a field tech. I processed to call Comcast back 2 more times for an ETA and no one
 was able to give me any information besides that the tech would call me as soon as they were
 available. At the end of the day, NO ONE came out and I was stuck losing a day of work and pay.
 There still has been no follow up on this open escalation ticket."
304026,Comcast Internet,5/22/2015,5:42:50 PM,Internet,Chicago,Illinois,60618,Solved,No,"On Monday, May 18, 2015, I contacted Comcast customer service and asked to schedule a transfer
 of phone and internet services to a new address, to take effect on June 13th. Simply scheduling the
 transfer took more than two hours. I was disconnect twice, and during my third call, a Comcast
 representative, named Elizabeth Kilpatrick, stated that I could not transfer services unless I added
 cable television services to my account. When I indicated that I did not want cable television
 services, she directed that I could simply use it if my satellite services were unavailable, but that it
 was a necessary portion of the bundle.
 Apparently, Ms. Kilpatrick improperly entered the transfer order. As a result, my phone and internet
 services were immediately disconnected. On Tuesday, May 19, 2015, I spent more than five hours
 on the phone with Comcast customer service trying to resolve the problem. I spoke to more than a
 dozen representatives in at least the following departments: customer service, technical support,
 billing, customer solutions, activations, transfers, and ""resolutions."" I was disconnected at least five
 times and had to restart the entire process multiple times. After more than five hours on the phone, at
 9:30 PM, I was told that nothing could be done to restore service as the necessary departments were
 closed. Services were not restored.
 On Wednesday, May 20, 2015, I again spent more than five hours attempting to restore service.
 After being disconnected another half dozen times, I was directed by a Customer Solutions
 representative to hang up, leave work, and travel to the nearest Comcast Customer Service Center -
 nearly 10 miles away - because only the local branch could resolve the problem (despite the fact the
 problem was created at a national call center). Upon arriving at the Customer Service Center, I was
 instructed that they did not have the tools to restore my service at that location. After nearly three
 hours at that location, I was asked to leave as the Center was closing. Services were not restored. I
 was also informed that my telephone number had re-entered the pool of available numbers, as it was
 no longer provisioned to my account, and could be reassigned to another customer. I was unable to
 port my number to another provider.
 On Thursday, May 21, 2015, after more calls, more disconnections, being on hold for hours again,
 services were finally restored.
 On Friday, May 22, 2015, I called Comcast and was instructed that no transfer was scheduled on
 either of the two accounts that I now had with the company - the original or the new one that had to
 be created to restore service. Moreover, no transfer could be scheduled until I paid the $220+ bill on
 my account. As an aside, I am (or was) enrolled in Comcast's automatic payments system, which
 automatically deducts payments from my account. The $220 bill also included $80 or so of ""past due""
 charges. When I inquired as to the source of these charges, I was told that $80 came from my ""old""
 (now closed) account, and it was past due because the account had been closed. No payment had
 been due on my account when I originally called on May 18, 2015. The remaining $140 was
 apparently for ""installation"" and ""activation"" of my ""new"" account. In other words, Comcast has
 charged me over $200 to restore service that it improperly disconnected.
 As a telecommunications attorney, I bill my clients by the hour. The value of the time lost in trying to
 direct Comcast in how to remedy its own mistakes is more than $8,000. My wife, who is an
 independent pediatric speech language pathologist, had interruption to her business in an amount
 totaling more than $3,000. When all of the above was explained to Comcast representative, I was
 told that I would have to pay my bill before any of my complaints or problems could be further
 addressed. To date, there has been no resolution."

 could self install and would need to send a self install package with a cable card. They sent the
 package, no card, so I sent it back and they said they would send a cable box for inventory reasons. I
 received it, they tried to help me install via web chat, turns out they sent me an old broken box. i had
 to send that back too. I gave them the modem number, and they said they couldn't get a signal so
 they would need to send a technician . technician said everything was fine, and he said he didn't
 know why Comcast kept telling people they can self install because he needed to come out and apply
 Comcast cables outside. I continued to have internet outages everyday, I called them and they sent
 another tech out, he contradicted the first tech. also, when I called again, they said my account was
 changed from the internet plus package to the economy package, I didn't do this, they said it was
 fixed. over the course of the next 10 days, I called in when I saw my bill online, it was filled with
 charges including, 3 tech visits at $39.95(there were only 2 and supposed to be free), 2 package
 deliveries at $9.95(also their fault and supposed to be free) and so on. I was transferred, hung up on,
 and spoke and typed to so many agents to deal with the charges, when I also found out that they
 were charging me more for the deal I just signed up for online, and could not change it back being
 that it was ""unavailable"". I explained that I already signed up for it , it was still available online, and
 they kept saying that different places and groups have different deals, and they transferred me to
 everyone, hung up, promised calls back, and lied over and over. They said it was an online deal and
 had to be dealt with online. the online people, web chat people, said they couldn't do anything, only
 supervisors. I finally couldn't take it anymore and canceled. only then after yelling that I just want out
 and please cancel now, did they start to say, ok , maybe we can help you with that. I have never been
 treated to badly , or felt more sick to my stomache, or been more disgusted by a company in my life.
 all this and more was only less than 2 weeks into have their service. the day I finally said enough, I
 had no internet service for 10 hours. since I cancelled I keep getting calls from them about ""helping""
 me. this is the worst customer service, and worst form of fraud and false advertising I've ever
 encountered. These are some of the agents I dealt with, don't know if the names are actually
 real...Laquandria, manager Kendra Williams who promised a call that never came, Natasha, Javier
 Cavalir in Florida who also promised a call that never came and gave me a fake number to call for
 help, Linda Misky, Sharon, Pretty Aldrelyn(web chat name), Kyle, Chris, and many others. All rude,
 condescending, and liars. They completely and in the worst way take advantage of the fact that there
 are not that many internet options out there, but I would rather have nothing than ever deal with that
 disgusting excuse for a company again."
305594,Comcast is giving me poor quality customer service.,5/25/2015,3:05:36 AM,Internet,Chicago,Illinois,60626,Open,No,"I had ordered an Internet modem as part of my xfinity plan on Monday may 17th and the box was
 suppose to arrive Friday may 22nd as a self install unit. it did arrive on time but when I tried installing
 it myself i noticed the only way to install it was with a cable technician coming out to my apartment as
 there is no coax connection inside my apartment. I called customer service immediately to send a
 technician to my house. the first time I called I was on hold for 20 minutes until someone answered.
 once they answered they said they had set up an appointment for Monday may 25th at a time frame
 of 1-3pm. They sent an email with a link in case I wanted to reschedule. When I clicked on the link it
 took me to my account but it said I had no appointment scheduled for my account. it worried me so
 the next day Saturday may 23rd I called customer service again to tell them about my problem. one
 lady said she would redirect me to the correct line to fix my problem but all she did was hang up. I
 called back and was placed on hold for 25 minutes AGAIN so I decided to quit and call the next day. I
 called again sunday may 24th to customer service and explained to them my problem. the lady said
 there was still no appointment set up for my account. I was furious and asked if there was anything I
 can do or why I even got the email to reschedule an ""appointment"" I never even got. She finally set
 up an appointment for me but said the earliest appointment available would be fore Friday may 29th. I
 am beyond furious that I had been lied to about a technician coming to my house Monday and now I
 have to wait a whole other week after my package has arrived just for the service to be installed. My
 phone has ran out of data and I needed the wifi so my phone company would stop charging me for
 going over my data limit. I now have to wait a whole week for my internet to be installed after
 expecting it to be only one day. I haven't even started my business with Comcast as a customer and
 they're already showing poor customer service quality. I wish I could talk to a supervisor or higher
 manager to get my point across. I feel disrespected for being hung up on the second time I called and
 also for being lied about having an appointment that was actually never set up. I wish to talk to a
 higher manager or supervisor as I had cancelled plans on Monday may 25th to wait on a cable
 technician just to find out that appointment was never really made. If I can't get an appointment at a
 sooner time I might just have to cancel my account before it's even activated due to how they treat

We had a window time frame of 10-12pm. Finally 11:33 I received a phone call from the comcast 800 number and a man on the phone says that the tech is outside my apartment and confirmed my address and I said great I'll be right down to let him in. I go outside and no one is there no tech no truck. Then my wife calls me from her job stating The Tech doesn't have the equipment to install our Internet. Then I told her that i just got a call from the 800 number about tech being at our apartment and while im still outside no one is there! Now more then 10 minutes later i receive another phone call from 800 number stating that the tech left because no one was home! I was outside the whole time no one ever showed up. We our first time customers. When we called to customer service nobody even cared we were called liars!

318605,Comcast internet,6/2/2015,12:22:55 PM,Internet,Chicago,Illinois,60614,Closed,No,"I've had a problem with Comcast and their service for quite some time now. When I had service with them my internet never really worked. My Wi-Fi never really worked. My connection was always going out but I stayed with them considering I didn't have time to stay on the phone with them everyday due to the fact that I have a job. They ended up disconnecting my service due to my bill. When I called to take care of the situation no one was able to help, literally no one wanted to pickup the phone. I stayed on hold for about 20 minutes every time I called. I called 3 times. They encourage you to go online to take care of bills so eventually that's what I did. On May 31, 2015 I paid $59.94 towards my account via the internet, by the way not using their Wi-Fi. My online bill stated that I needed to pay that amount and the rest was due my the middle of June. I call back Tuesday the 2nd of June to find out that my services have been totally disconnected therefore I no longer have an account with them. When I called, that's when I finally get a person to talk to and he states, you have to pay an additional $61 to restore my services. I informed him that's not what it said online. He completely disregarded that and continued to tell me I needed to pay $61. A company that encourages you to pay online, you'd think all info would be correct. They lied and completely fabricated the truth entirely. I paid the amount that was asked but they still insist, no that's not all. My services are still out. I'm out of $60 from them and they still don't help me. Poor internet service, poor customer service, poor company completely! Please help!!!
 Thank you

325959,horrible service charges for tech/installation applied when they shouldnt have,6/5/2015,4:59:04 PM,Internet,Chicago,Illinois,60620,Solved,Yes,"I made the mistake and got Comcast internet almost two months ago. First it took almost two weeks due to them having another tenant listed in my apartment#1. Then I had to keep calling kept getting the run around. Then finally when it was alledgedly straighten out. The CSR told me that the $60.00 charge for installation/tech would be waived and that she could not do it that day due to the ""billing"" process which was another lie. I called back the next day after installation to make sure the account was updated and was told that ""oh yes, dont worry about it it will automatically be updated. Of course that wasn't done. Service was interrupted on 5/30/2015 and I spent over 3 hours calling the 800#, talking with billing and them telling me there wasn't anything that they could do. Then I tried dialing local comcast and they didn't know what to do. I asked several times to speak to a Supervisor last Saturday and was denied and switched back into the que to start all over again. My bill is suppose to be $29.99 plus tax per month. Not the first bill of 95.00 Comcast has lied over and over including expecting me to talk to the tenant and go into the local office when the technician who installed service for the other knew they were not in my apartment # and he should have called it in to verify it and CHANGE THE APT#. It has been nothing but HELL since the first conversation. Why would anyone agree to a$60.00 charge to hook up internet when you can clearly do it yourself. It's not hard. I even said no to the charge and it was suppose to have been waived because it took comcast over a week to supply the service and now the one person that I did speak to on June 1st, is stating a ""play on the words"" that the csr entered when she put the service order in. GO BACK AND LOOK UP MY ACCOUNT AND LISTEN TO YOUR QA CALLS. See how many times I called in the beginning and how many times I called on 5/29 and 5/30/2015. This is ridiculous. I'm going to keep calling someone in the State of Illinois including a BBB complaint until it is resolved. Denying me a Supervisor. Waiting for 3-45 mn per call for someone to answer not including the csr who have me a 800# that isn't even associated with Comcast. Then because I didn't have the bill with the account # on it and my mother was on the phone trying to help me the csr stated she could not look it up by telephone# or last four of ssn which is an outright lie. Comcast hooked service up in the basement of someone who gave their apartment# as #1 instead of basement. The tech rang my bell in 12/2014 when he came out stating that he had an order for apartment#1. I said no he didn't but he apparently installed it anyway knowing these people did not live in apt#1. But, sent me through hell stating that they took my slot in the two flat building. This held my service up for over 10 days. No apology or anything. Then you want to add $60.00 for a tech. No way. I didnt even know that Comcast mailed the equipment until my 20th phone call. Comcast is training its employees to make the sale by saying whatever is necessary. Then when you try to call back with questions or try to resolve any problems you get treated like crap. Since more than one person exhibited this behavior it must be common place. LISTEN TO YOUR CALLS! LOOK UP THE ACCOUNT AND LISTEN TO THE CALLS.

Classic bait and switch tactics knowing it is a pain to switch companies and reconnect everything.

339886,comcast: no service for one month,6/14/2015,12:27:53 PM,Internet,Chicago,Illinois,60657,Solved,No,"We opened our account with Comcast mid- May of 2015. Since then we have had no Internet service. This is despite 5 appointments in which Comcast technicians came to our apartment. None of the technicians have provided us with service and claim that another appointment is required to fix the issue, which is always changing and never resolved. Additionally, on three separate occasions we waited for a scheduled appointment for 2 hours before learning the technician was not coming. First, the claim was that their system accidentally deleted the appointment. The second time the person writing the ticket wrote our phone number incorrectly and the tech never called the number on the account. The third time a supervisor promised an escalated appointment time and the technician never called to confirm. Today another technician came out and claimed we needed new wiring however it had been replaced by a team of three technicians the previous appointment. We are being charged for non existent services and Comcast doesn't seem to be interested in rectifying the problem.

 I have a small business at 4001 W Devon Ave, ste 340, CHicago, IL 60646. Comcast is the ""ONLY"" internet provider in this building. Even AT&T does not have any internet connections here. Due to this, Comcast charges excessive amount of $70+other charges for a basic internet service. Also, the force to have a 2 year contract to get this price.
 I am stuck since there is no other option and Comcast has complete monopoly in this context. Similar internet for personal use is sold for just $30 but Comcast is inflating the prices to take advantage of this monopoly in this region.

 I am at 4001 W Devon Ave, Chicago, IL 60646. Comcast is the only provider in the building. Their basic internet has been priced at 70 dollars and they insist that they will not give me xfinity product because building is a business address. The basic internet has other fees like $200 of installation fee unless you sign for 2-3 years of contract (even when you supply your own equipment). I received a call from Comcast that suggested that they charge $70 for basic internet everywhere but that is not true. In residential buildings where there are other options, comcast sells similar services for 24.99. Comcast told me that there is a data cap in 24.99 service. I asked them to sell me that same service with data cap to me ( I am not against data cap) but they will not.
 Comcast is exploiting this monopoly and taking advantage of people like me. I need FCC to intervene and ensure that ordinary citizens should have reasonable access to internet as reasonable cost.

They gave me a ""promotional"" deal for the first year, but then refused to honor it for the second year. The only way I could get the speeds without switching carriers was to pay an extra $30 and upgrade to a ""Basic Cable"" bundle(which I do not want), which only includes non-HD versions of the channels I already receive OTA. Additionally, they have encrypted these basic cable channels, requiring me to lease an ""HD"" box, instead of being able to use my TV's built in tuner. I was then sent a box and charged a ""Self-Install fee"" even I explicitly told them not to (I was told that a supervisor would call me back to record my complaint - its 35 days later, and Im still waiting)

358620,Tricked into upgrade,6/23/2015,2:24:35 PM,Internet,Chicago,Illinois,60618,Solved,No,"I was basically harassed with calls for weeks from Comcast every day asking me if I wanted to upgrade form basic internet to a faster internet with HBO and Basic cable. I said no every time until I finally couldn't take it any more and as it was only $10 more every month I just did it. HOWEVER. The only reason i did was because they strictly told me I could cancel and go back to my ORIGINAL deal if I didn't want it within 30 days. Somewhere within that timeframe, I called and cancelled because I dont even watch TV. I was told my original deal wasn't available any longer and I would just end up paying more for internet alone if I took away the TV/HBO. I think that is absurd and I want to go back to our original payment and internet speed without HBO or TV.

361003,Comcast Unfair Business Practices,6/24/2015,9:24:05 AM,Internet,Chicago,Illinois,60626,Solved,No,"Comcast's primary business method seems to be committing the biggest bait and switch possible on the American Public. My story is not the only similar story, and in fact is rather mild on the Comcast Scale.
 When I signed up for my current internet service with Comcast, I like many others was offered a lower promotional rate. The Comcast representative told me that when my rate goes up after the promo discount, to call customer service and there would be an option to reclaim that promotional rate, or something similar. I called customer service soon after setting up my internet service, and was guaranteed the same thing by a second representative.
 When my rate increased, my call to customer service was frustrating to say the least. On several occasions, I was told that lowering the rate after the promotional deal expired is not something the company does, nor do they even have a lower rate than what I was paying. Which is patently false, as my billing statement from the month previous was near 50% lower than the new ""standard"" rate. I was then told I had the lowest possible price, and offered several other packages, all which were significantly more expensive as an alternative. I was also not told about their broadband-only packages as required after the purchase of NBCUniversal.

360620,Faulty Service and False Advertisement,6/24/2015,12:22:34 AM,Internet,Chicago,Illinois,60607,Solved,No,"On June 24, 2015, I contracted with Comcast Xfinity internet for a $19.99 a month package for 3 mbps. I have experienced interruptions and problems to the service. After speaking with Comcast on the phone to explain my issues, they recommended I upgrade my internet speed package for $49.99 a month with 25 mbps internet speed. I purchased this package in hopes my internet speed would increase. However, my internet speed has not. Please see the enclosed pictures as proof. As I have not received the service I contracted for I consider Comcast in a breach of contract. I expect them to rectify this breach of contract and provide the services I paid for. I request a reimbursement of $138.18 which represents the proportion of the sum I have paid for the service that I have not received.

366291,Comcast started charging a lease fee for equipment I own after enabling automatic bill payment,6/25/2015,4:35:18 PM,Internet,Chicago,Illinois,60625,Solved,No,"I enabled automatic payments on my Comcast account on 7/17/2014. I was comfortable enabling automatic payments as my previous bills had consistently been the same amount. That changed a couple billing cycles later.
 From November 2014 to March 2015, Comcast charged me a DOCSIS 3 Modem lease fee for the cable modem that I own. After multiple phone calls and much confusion from Comcast customer service representatives, the charges have stopped and my account will be credited. The first charge was $8.00, the four subsequent cycles were $10.00.
 I still feel the need to file a complaint regarding their negligent business practices. There were no changes made to my account prior to the charges appearing. I should not have to inspect my bill each month for erroneous charges - Comcast should have a system in place to prevent this sort of thing.
 I have attached my billing statements for the last 15 months as proof.

373777,Comcast/Xfinity Service Manipulation,6/29/2015,10:05:50 PM,Internet,Chicago,Illinois,60618,Solved,No,"My primary complaint is that Comcast/Xfinity has manipulated there service delivery to me during my moving process. I prepared by calling Comcast ahead of time to transfer my service address. I did this because my wife and I work from home and require internet. I was approved for a ""self-install"" (plug in my own equipment and be good to go). After 5 days I found out from the Comcast technician that my building was not wired for comcast service. Comcast manipulated their service area in order to keep my business even though they knew that my building was not wired for service. I lost 4-days of work and had to call off work due there manipulation. No apology or compensation has been issued at this time. Below is the timeline of events
 - On 7/16/15, I filed for my service to be stopped on 7/20/15 and transferred to my new address on 7/21/15. I was then approved for a ""self install"" on 7/21.
 - My tv/internet/phone was turned off on 7/18/15. I called Comcast on 7/18/15 and I was told that our service could not be turned back on because we were moving. After a hour on the phone I was told that our service will be turned back on in 24 hours. It was not turned back on. I called on 7/19/15 but I was told the same thing that I was told the previous day.
 - On 7/21/15 I attempted to ""self install"" my equipment with no success. I called tech support but was told that I needed to call the ""sales department because my account was terminated."" When I called back on 7/22/15 I was told that my account has been re-activated and it will take 1-5 hours for the system to turn my equipment back on.
 - On 7/23/15 I called back when my service still was not working, customer support stated that that they will have to send a technician to my apartment to turn on my service. The appointment was for 7/24/15 between 10:00am-Noon.
 - No technician arrived on 7/24/15, I called and I was told that my appointment was rescheduled for 7/25/15 for 10:00am-noon. I was not notified of the appointment change.
 - When the technician arrived I was told that the building was not wired for comcast and he had to ""wire the building."" I had full service on 7/25/15.

I've had three technicians come out to determine the problem, and every technician has disagreed on the cause. The first said my line was bad. The second said the building's cable box is to blame. The third said the cable box was fine, and my modem must be the problem. I got a new modem, and it couldn't even hold a stable signal. Now its been over a month and I still don't have a reliable connection. I was even in contact with a technician supervisor, and made plans to leave work early so he could fix the issue, only to have him ignore my calls.

264757,Xfinity Order Status,4/29/2015,4:31:16 PM,Internet,Citrus Heights,California,95621,Closed,No,"I have been an Xfinity customer for over 3 years. I pay them over $60 a month for just internet service. When I initially signed up with them over three years ago, their sales representative checked my service area and promised me download speeds of 25mbs and upload speeds of 6-8mbs. They also sold me on renting the modem from them and buying the router from them as well which I did since they described the modem and router as best in the market. When their installer guy came out to my house, he wanted to drill holes all over the walls to install which I had to help him figure out a way to minimize the drilling. I then asked him about the modem and router being installed. He said the modem is an okay brand but he has never heard of the router brand. I was already at a point where I said just install the equipment so I can get going. My router crashed within 5 days of use and would not give out any connection. After 3 days of calling Xfinity customer service, getting the run-around, being transferred to 4 different departments, being hung up on 3 times and them telling me ""Well the sales department will try to sell you on anything they can and there is nothing we can do"", I figured I will just take my loss and go buy a new router which I did. I bought a decent router for about $80. Ever since I have had the modem, my speeds have been at almost dial up level. I have tested my modem speed and it shows I get about 4 MBS download and less than 1 MBS upload. I contacted Xfinity numerous times about it and all they did was have me restart my modem and unplug my modem over and over again. I finally asked them if they can ship me a new or updated modem. I spoke with the representative on 4/13/2015 but did not get his name. He processed my order and confirmed I will receive my order in 3-5 days maximum. I did not receive my modem in that time period so I called Xfinity again on 4/22/15 and spoke with Denise in customer service department. She confirmed with me that my order was processed and is on its way and that I should see it arrive in about 3 days. I still did not receive anything from Xfinity. In the meantime, I am paying them for service and I have almost zero connection 5 out of the 7 days of the week. So I contacted Xfinity again today 4/29/15 and spoke with David who advised me that my order was cancelled. I asked who cancelled it, he said he did not know, I said what might have caused it to be cancelled, David did not know that either. I asked for the representativeâ€™s name that processed my order initially, David said there was no name, just a note that showed the order being processed. At this point I was beside myself and decided to file this complaint as it has been almost 3 weeks since I have placed my order for my product and still have nothing. David had to re-process my order and at this point I will have to wait another 5 days for my order to arrive (assuming it does not get cancelled again). In the meantime, they have continuously charged me my monthly rate for an outdated product that they sent me that does not even connect. Can someone please look into this as I feel I deserve to be compensated for my time and money I have paid them for all this time. Thank you for your consideration.

354309,Billing/Customer Service,6/20/2015,8:56:19 PM,Internet,Citrus Heights,California,95610,Solved,No,"I initially signed up for the Comcast Internet Plus Blast with 105 MBPS (listed as $49.99) in early April. I had never had Comcast before, and stupidly didn't listen to friends and family who warned me against them. Thinking that this was a good deal, I had called one of their representatives for my apartment complex to confirm that the promotion was still available and request installation for April 19, 2015.
 The technician showed up within the quoted time frame, and had no idea what promotion I was talking about. Due to a language difference, neither of us could figure out what the other was saying. We spent about 20 minutes getting nowhere until he assured me that I was getting what I requested. Aside from a SUPER slow MBPS speed of 20, everything on the video end seemed to be correct.
 I received my first bill a few weeks later. I immediately noticed that the package was listed incorrectly on my bill as ""Internet Blast Plus 25."" I was still getting internet speeds much lower than I was paying for and had been charged for a package over $60 and discounted to reach the $50 range. I was double charged a $37.50 instillation fee (I was quoted $35) and charged $10 for an HD box that I did not request and was not informed of.
 I proceeded to play phone tag with my ""representative"" for nearly two weeks. After being promised that the issue would be fixed and seeing no results, I contacted Comcast's customer service department over the phone. I was told that they had never heard of this promotion before and that they would be unable to honor it for me, even though I had a screen shot on my phone and wanted to email them a copy. I was told to go to my nearest Comcast store for assistance.
 The next morning I did just that. I was told by the higher ups at the Roseville location that they would fix the package in the system and upgrade it on my account. They seemed very eager to help me and I was relieved that I finally had someone who appeared to care about my frustrations. They told me that they would estimate the updated charge and I could pay it then as a credit to my account, as they weren't able to see the updated amount due. I ended up paying $118 and was assured that I would see an update in speed when I got home. I did, but 45 MBPS is still much lower than the 105 I was promised.
 I was sick of dealing with the issue and was hoping that the speeds would get better in time. They never did. Fast forward a month to today. I received a new bill in the mail for $152.12. According to this bill, I had not paid $71.63 and was charged $10 in late fees along with the most current bill of $80.49. Needless to say I had not received anything from Comcast since my initial incorrect billing statement that I had thought to have resolved in the store. Part of this charge was a $17 charge for a ""Speed Increase,"" with a $7 ""Service Discount."" Seriously!? My package is still incorrect, I am still not
 getting the speeds I was originally promised, and now they are trying to charge me even more money.
 I immediately called customer service, again, to be told that I must have missed the bill in the mail. I informed the representative that I had never received it and requested that they drop the late fee if I paid the total amount immediately by credit card over the phone. He informed me that Comcast would not, and that they would also charge me $5 for paying over the phone. He told me that if I did not want to pay the $5 over the phone fee that I could again go to the Roseville store for assistance, but that they would not drop the late fee either. I was so frustrated that I hung up on him and paid the total bill online.
 I am so sick of Comcast. The do not deliver on their promotions and service speeds but are not afraid to charge you additional money wherever they can and without your consent. I am still not receiving the speeds I was promised, am still being charged for an HD box I did not want or request, was not sent a physical bill for last month's billing statement as I had requested, charged with a $10 late fee anyway, as well as a extra $10 ""Speed Increase"" charge. Their representatives are shady, unhelpful, and uncaring.

215755,Comcast lies and deception,4/3/2015,8:24:30 AM,Internet,Clarkston,Michigan,48348,Closed,No,"I called Comcast on 3/30/2015 to get a higher Internet speed. I was put on hold and was disconnected. I called back and tried the call back feature. They called back and I missed the call so I started over. After much discussion I was told I could get a deal with TV and 2 movie channels and 25mbs Internet speed for close to $60 a month. So they changed the speed and I checked for the 2 movie channels and found none. I called back and asked for just 25mbs internet. Put on hold and disconnected. I feel they are evading and misleading costumers. There are a lot of complaints on line about this type of strategy of frustrating customers until they just give up and keep their poor service. I called back again and finally got information on 25mbs internet only for $44 a month for 1 year . I kept asking to verify this price and the agent kept saying this was the correct price and I would get an email stating the details. The email stated it would be $75 a month. I called back and asked for a supervisor. I was told the $75 was what I would be charged for 25mbs internet and no tv. I was lied to and manipulated into getting something I didnt ask for. I see in forums this is what Comcast does to get clients into higher priced packages. It is fraud, lies and corruption. Actually it is a corrupt business of racketeering across state lines that is covered under the RICO act.

362724,Comcast Billing,6/24/2015,4:37:27 PM,Internet,Clinton,Maryland,20735,Open,No,"1. On April 24, 2015 I called Comcast to inform them that we were moving to a new location and asked to have our services transferred there. Our current contract at our old home was a bundled package for $109/month.
 2. We were told that our bill would increase to $159/month for the bundled package because the promotion could not be transferred to our new address that is located approximately 7 miles away.
 3. We asked Comcast to cancel the service because we were unwilling to pay the additional $50 for the same service
 4. A service rep named Lawrence then told us that we could transfer the promotional cost of the service to the new address. He noted that he would have the billing reflect that we would pay $109 for the bundled services by April 27, 2015.
 5. When we received our first bill from Comcast at the new address, we were charged $159 for the bundled service.
 6. We called Comcast on June 16 2015 and were told during that phone call that the bill would be adjusted to reflect that we would pay $109 for the bundled service. When we paid our bill on June 20, 2015 it was reduced by over $100, which I assumed was the adjusted bill.
 7. I received a new bill on June 25, 2015 that itemized the bundled package costing $159. When I called Comcast re why this package is not the agreed upon $109/month, the service rep told me that she is not sure why anyone would tell me they could reduce the cost of the bundled package because the promotional costs do not transfer to new addresses. She also told me I had 30 days to change my mind about the service and since I did not cancel the service in 30 days, we are responsible for paying the $159 for the bundled.
 8. We would like Comcast to honor their agreement to us that we would be charged $109/month for the bundled package and have that rate reflected on each subsequent bill. We would also like Comcast to reimburse us for a total of $100 that represents the additional $50 that we paid on our bill for the May 2015 and June 2015 bill. If Comcast refuses to honor their agreement with us, we would like to terminate our services with Comcast without a termination fee since they did not honor their agreement with us.

The comcast salesperson , Mr. Richard Feliciano asked me to sign a 2 year contract to which I protested as I knew I was only going to live in Florida for a year to 15 months. Mr Feliciano told me not to worry as in the event I move, they can transfer the services to my new address. He said Comcast/xfinity is a,""nationwide"" company and there should be no problem. In January 2015, I informed them I was moving to Closter, New Jersey. I was flabbergasted to find out they don't provide services to my current address. I wanted to continue with their services but they couldn't provide it. They penalized me an early termination fee of $ 700.00 when it was Comcast who could not fulfill their part of the contract. While it's true that the guarantee of moving the service is not written, you can anonymously call any comcast office and I guarantee you that you will receive the same verbal assurance/lie that they can move the service nayionwide.

323310,Comcast/Xfinity,6/4/2015,1:28:36 PM,Internet,Clovis,California,93612,Closed,No,"See complaint #126096. My email changed in and around Feb. 11th 2015. So my has changed to I had complained originally about keeping my email address that I had with comcast before I changed to ATT uverse on 2/10/15. I called comcast the day after my services were installed by AT@T as I was advised. I did speak to a Kit in the corporate office. That said she never got any email address complaint issue from FCC. She said they had no record of my cancelling my service on training notes they had made. But my experience with Comcast is in Sept. 2014 and thru October 2014 when I transfered service to the location I live at now . They didn't get half the messages I left. I had to go to other Departments within Comcast. So it didn't surprise me they had no training record. They don't tell you that you may be taped for training purposes. I started Uverse service on 2/10/15. I have copies of all 3 service with AT@T internet, tv and phone. I live on social security I wouldn't have kept both going. I did ask what my last bill would be when I called in Feb. Told about 103.00 plus 20.00 from my old bill. I also discussed they would be getting a complaint from FCC as well as AT@T to try to keep my old email. Which the guy who signed me up with ATT. uverse promised. Kit was rude to me . Tried to trip me up I kept saying 2/10/15. She said she only saw a call on 3/10/15. She got me off track and kept referring to 3/10/15. Trying to put words in my mouth. They could of check my call record on my voice mail and to see services weren't being used. I did call Comcast again in March around 3/10/15 to find out why I was still be charged for all 3 triple play services. I spoke to customer service first who sent me to another department. That person said I was being charge for internet only. I attempted to dispute this but she wouldn't budge or address my issues. If you stay with comcast they aren't as rude but leave them and they don't care what the customer has to say. This has been a mess since the origiunal complaint with you in Feburary. As before in October 2014 Comcast workmen left open a electrical door that in 6 inches or so off the ground. We have kids in this complex and if it rains that wiring could short out. They were working on this box for another customer at the beginning of May or end of April 2015. I called to tell them about it. That box is still wide open. It needs a certain key to lock and close. As they did with this dangerous issue in October 2014 leaving it un fixed they are doing it again. But of Course they keep such good records. I blocked the door with a something I owned and 2 days later it was stolen. If it causes a fire or a young child or even a animal is hurt. They are liable.

But now that we have the Xbox, we all of a sudden drop from 128Mbps to anywhere from 25Mbps to 50Mbps if we are lucky to get even that but the upload speeds remain at 10-12Mbps. It's clear that we are being penalized for having an Xbox after years of service to the same company who has a monopoly on the entire surrounding area, and frankly a $200+ monthly bill should provide the service that I'm supposedly ""guaranteed"".

 HADN'T MISSED ME. I WAS ON THE PHONE!!!!!!! What if I had been in the BATHROOM!!! I called
 Comcast, waited 8 minutes on hold and informed the REP that I was at the HOUSE WAITING and
 the REP TOLD ME YOU'RE SCHEDULED for between 10-12 PM. There will be someone there. I
 asked, ""ARE YOUR SURE?"" The Rep answered, ""Yes, your status is OPEN. Someone will be at
 your house between 10-12."" WHEN NO ONE was at my house by 12, I called Comcast at 12:29
 and was TOLD, the other REP didn't LOOK FAR ENOUGH, YOUR STATUS IS CLOSED!!!! I asked
 for a TECH TO BE SENT as I AM STILL SITTING HERE WAITING. At 1:50 PM, I was told that
 someone would call me BACK within 1/2 hour to TELL ME IF A TECH COULD MAKE IT TODAY.
 REALLY???? ANOTHER wasted hour of time. At 1:16 PM, I received a CALL FROM COMCAST.
 ""Unfortunately, no one can come to your house today. There are no techs available in your area.""
 THIS IS Comcast's POLICY: IF for ANY REASON YOU CANNOT REACH YOUR PHONE WHEN
 COMCAST CALLS AFTER COMCAST HAS ALREADY SENT A CONFIRMATION EMAIL, whether
 you're on the toilet or your child has an emergency and you can't get to the phone to answer , YOU
 LOSE YOUR APPT, YOUR CASE IS CLOSED, EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE WAITING IN YOUR
 HOME AT THE SCHEDULED AND APPOINTED TIME AND EVEN THOUGH YOU CALL AND TELL
 COMCAST YOU ARE IN YOUR HOUSE AND YOU COULDN'T ANSWER THE PHONE.
 So WHEN COMCAST CALLS YOUR PHONE and you use a walker and can't get to the phone to
 answer it, YOUR SCHEDULED APPT IS CANCELLED--even if YOU CALL COMCAST AND TELL
 THE REP YOU'RE IN YOUR HOUSE. WAITING!!!!
 Why do I care? Because tomorrow FPL is turning the electric off in my house so that I can have NEW
 ELECTRIC PANEL WIRING. AND NOW, I DON'T HAVE AVAILABLE TIME THE REST OF THE
 WEEK--SO I AM WAITING FOR A SUPERVISOR to RETURN from LUNCH to CALL ME and
 EXPLAIN WHY THERE ARE NO TECHS AVAILABLE FOR MY APPT TODAY THAT COMCAST
 CANCELLED AND THEN MISREPRESENTED TO ME THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN CANCELLED.
 But when I went onto Comcast to get my account number, MY APPT is STILL SCHEDULED at 2:02
 PM in the AFTERNOON! I have attached copy of that as well. Please look in the lower right hand
 corner.

 I just got off the phone with Comcast again and was told that no tech could come today, I must
 reschedule. I was also told that a tech came to my house, a yellow house with a white
 door. NOT POSSIBLE! I have TWO DOGS that BARK if I drop something on the floor. If ANYONE
 had been near my house while I was on the phone, the BARKING WOULD HAVE BEEN
 HORRENDOUS. I have not left the house. My house is green with a white door. My carport is
 open and a car can be seen and I have two dogs. The tech from Friday would know that I have a
 green house with a white door. NO ONE HAS BEEN HERE. AND, when did the ""Someone was at
 your house"" appear on the computer? It certainly was not there at 11:29 am when I called and the
 Rep confirmed that I still had my appointment. All of the sudden there's a description of a yellow
 house with a white door. Where was it between 10:50 AM when the apt was cancelled and 11:29
 AM, or 12:30 PM? Thank you. Please do not let Comcast feed you misinformation.

359317,Comcast billing practices,6/23/2015,4:44:22 PM,Internet,Collinsville,Virginia,24078,Solved,No,"Much like the complaints of other Comcast subscribers, they are the only broadband provider available at my address and their billing practices are forcing me into paying for services I am not interested in having.
 I have expressed an interest in removing cable, in fact, I never wanted it in the first place. After talking to two different representatives on the phone, a representative in the store, as well as checking at specials available online, there are no other price options with reliable internet speed other than the one I currently have.
 My bill is over $80 in order to have just 25 mbps of download speed. I've looked at all options to lower it, because $80 is just too much in my budget in order to do some of my work at home from time to time. If I wish to cancel the cable service (that I was coerced to bundle in), I've been informed my bill would actually INCREASE. Opting for a lower speed would save pennies but drop my internet speed DRAMATICALLY to a mere 3 mbps of download or 6 mbps of download speed.
 I shouldn't be forced to subscribe to a service I do not want in order to be able to afford a reasonable (but still VERY slow in the grand scheme) internet speed.

254426,very poor customer service,4/24/2015,12:28:44 AM,Internet,Colonia,New Jersey,7067,Closed,No,"I purchased over the phone a plan for my internet, Security System, Phone and TV to be provided from Comcast. The technicians were supposed to show up on 4/16/2015 between 9am and 11am. A Tech showed up stated he only does security systems and that I needed additional appointments. He stated that I needed to call the main office as I needed a Tech who could provide all services. I contacted the number and through the day kept being told that someone would be coming. No one ever showed up. The last in a series of phone calls I was told that a technician who can ""do it all"" will be at my home on 4/23/2015 between 9am and 11am. Since I took the first day off of work my wife then stayed at home on the 23rd. No one showed on 4/23/2015 and after repeated telephone calls through the day we were told that someone would come next Tuesday. In addition on 4/23/2015 my home phone which I was switching to Comcast from Verizon was shut off and my Verizon internet that I was switching to Comcast was shut off. I contacted Verizon and they said Comcast had it shut down as I was switching over. So now we sit with no house phone, no internet, no upgraded TV and no security system. We cannot keep taking days off of work for these appointments where no one shows up.

257026,"Tried to cancel, was lied to about change in service",4/25/2015,2:48:21 PM,Internet,Colorado Springs,Colorado,80903,Closed,Yes,"On March 12, 2015, I called Comcast to request cancellation of my home internet service. My year of promotional pricing for the 50 Mbps service was up and we were looking to reduce the cost of our broadband service. CenturyLink is offering us a 20 Mbps service for $29.95 for one year with a one year contract plus a $25 Visa prepaid card. The retention representative my wife and I spoke with said she would drop us to a 24 Mbps for $34.99 a month for one year after which we could attempt to re-negotiate for another deal or special. We accepted her offer because the broadband service from Comcast is stable and my wife works from home, so that is very important to us.
 I noticed a significant drop in speed after the conversation, but it wasn't until a few days later that I decided to visit speedtest.net to check the actual throughput speeds. I was very disappointed to see download speeds between six and seven Mbps and upload speeds around one Mbps.
 Shortly thereafter, I signed onto an online chat (transcript attached) with a Comcast billing rep who confirmed the plan we were downgraded to was actually a 6 Mbps plan for $34.99. I expressed my frustration and the rep transferred me to a chat with a product support specialist (I believe that was the department). This rep was not helpful at all and I told them I just wanted what I was promised, nothing more.
 During this chat, my internet service dropped and reconnected several times. As I stated earlier, our broadband is always extremely stable, so I can only assume this rep didn't want to deal with my issue and was cycling my connection on and off to get me to go away. I am sure this is unacceptable by any standard. I let the issue go until today because I hate dealing with this kind of run-around, but this needs to be resolved, so I called Comcast again. I spoke with a retention rep and told him about my issue and recounted my previous interactions with the Comcast reps. He stated that there is no 24 Mbps package and offered a 44 Mbps package for $44.95. I told him I only wanted what I was promised by the first retention rep and he said he couldn't do that. I asked to speak with a supervisor to lodge a complaint and he said he could submit it for me because he didn't want to raise his hand and wait for one of the few supervisors available today. He suggested I submit my concern via Comcast's customer feedback website. I thanked him for his help and have decided to file a complaint here.

287000,Xfinity Throttling Apple TV bitrate,5/13/2015,3:15:58 AM,Internet,Colorado Springs,Colorado,80918,Open,No,"When I use my Apple TV on my Airport Extreme router, I can stream videos, mainly because of the
 encryption protecting the server identity. But when I reconnect to the Xfinity Arris router instead of the
 Apple Airport Router, the connection will freeze up almost like an endless buffer. no progress is made
 usually. This happens mainly on the Youtube and HBO apps, sometimes on Netflix. When I check my
 connection speed, It's fast enough to stream. I typically get around 15 mb/s on my phone, 20-25mb/s
 on my computer, and 8-10 on the Apple TV. I've found that I am not the only one with this issue. I've
 come to the conclusion that Comcast is throttling my internet based on the device"
315874,Comcast Termination Fee,5/31/2015,5:54:06 PM,Internet,Colorado Springs,Colorado,80910,Solved,No,"I called yesterday to cancel my service and Comcast wanted to charged me about $170 for early
 termination. This amount to about 2 months service. If I wasn't in the military I would be faced with
 this charge. I am complaining because this fee has nothing to do with the service considering that it
 is just a ""flick of a button"" to turn off (or on) a service."
336234,Unresolved Issues,6/12/2015,7:59:56 AM,Internet,Colorado Springs,Colorado,80909,Closed,No,"I had comcast internet installed in February on a plan for 105MBPS. I have never gotten more than 40 and average between 30-35, although it regularly drops below 25. I have had more than 7 techs out and was charged anywhere from $30-$100 despite being covered not only by my plan, but also by the default policy based on my install date. It took more than 15 times contacting comcast between chat and phone calls to have those charges fixed. I filed a complaint previously with the FCC and was contact by a rep named kathy, however the complaint was closed, I never received any written communication about it but she stopped responding to either my emails or calls completely once it was closed. I still do not know what the ""resolution"" of the complaint supposedly was. A supervisor from another department called me back after I requested a call and I was told my apartment had to be rewired; the first two appointments were cancelled by comcast without informing me. The third time one was supposedly scheduled, they instead charged me $70 for a failed self install tech that did not and could not handle rewires. Almost two weeks later, my apartment was rewired and despite at least 5 prior techs telling me my apartment had recently been rewired, the cables apparently were a minimum of 10 years old. Once the rewire was done, my internet was performing at the same speeds. I was contacted by customer relations again (they had setup the rewire) and was told that my bill would be credited and a supervisor from maintenance would contact me within 24 hours. Almost a week later I got a call from someone stating they worked for Comcast, however they were laughing throughout the message they left me and I could not understand much of anything he said. I called the number back 4 times and left messages but never got a call back. I called the person I spoke to in customer relations again to explain the situation and asked that he call me back, or contact whoever was supposed to contact me again to get the problem resolved. That call was 4 days ago and I still have not heard from him or anyone else. It was nearly two weeks ago that he said someone would call within 24 hours. I just ran these speed tests (on ethernet) after running a complete scan and clean up on my PC: http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/4427333671
 http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/4427336058
 http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/4427340809
 It has been over four months since I originally reported this issue to comcast, and there has been absolutely no improvement, horrible communication, billing errors, work order errors, tech errors etc. They have not lowered my monthly rate despite the fact that I am not getting even the minimum speed of 50MBPS they have told me I should have, although I should almost always be closer to the 105 on ethernet and continue to make promises that they do not fulfill.

359931,no warning before price increase,6/23/2015,7:36:54 PM,Internet,Colorado Springs,Colorado,80907,Solved,No,"While I know it's common for the price to increase after the first year of service, I was given no warning before my bill suddenly increased by 50%. If I was notified beforehand, even just by email, that my service was about to become more expensive I would have had ample time to switch providers. Instead I'm stuck with a bill that's 50% higher than what I used to pay.
 A 50% increase is quite significant and I think it warrants a warning. I'm not sure if it's common practice to ignore your customers and let them be surprised by a large bill after the promotional period is over, but it shouldn't be.

368799,Comcast overbilling and overcharging,6/26/2015,4:26:20 PM,Internet,Colorado Springs,Colorado,80906,Solved,Yes,"Recently we relocated service from one Comcast installation to another location. First, they *required* that I have one of their techs come out to do the 'install' even though it consisted of just plugging the same equipment into the new location.
 I already had everything hooked up and working days before the tech came out, and when I called in I was told it was still required for a tech to come out and for us to pay a $50 fee.
 Prior to the transfer, we would pay Comcast for the month's actual use. So at the end of May we were paying our May bill.
 On transferring, Comcasat decided to change the billing date to the middle of the month. Rather than charging a pro-rated amount for the partial month, Comcast charged us for the full month but said payment was due mid-month.
 When I called to correct the billing dates, the indivdiual I spoke to on the phone said that it was explicitly written in our transfer order that the billing dates were going to change.
 No such language exists in the transfer documentation, and when I asked him to explain *where* in the documentation it said that, the rep was unable to. The billing department was unable to. No one was able to explain why we were being charged for 8 weeks of service in a 6 week span, other than to say ""it's normal for us to bill in advance.""
 Nothing in any of the actual documentation provided to us said anything of the sort, and if I had any other alternative I would take it.

354541,COMCAST SERVICE COMPLAINT,6/21/2015,10:40:18 AM,Internet,Columbia,Maryland,21044,Solved,No,"On June 10th, I called Comcast at 800-934-6489 to transfer my services to a new address. I told the agent I wanted to keep everything (cable and internet) the same as my previous address minus a cable box. The agent offered me a special for cable, Internet, phone, and home security; I told him I donâ€™t want the offer if it comes at an extra cost to my bill. He mentioned this would be saving me $100 from what I currently pay (average of $220 a month). He told me my account was up to date and the balance was at $0; I agreed to the new package. He offered me $100 gift card for being loyal and transferring my services. I thanked him for taking care of me and for being so pleasant. We scheduled an appointment for June 11th. On that same date, the services at my previous address were disconnected.
 On the 11th, the Comcast technician came to install but was unsuccessful. I didnâ€™t understand because this address (my motherâ€™s home) previously had Comcast as a provider. He stated the wires outside were cut and he needed to put in a work order for it to be repaired that can take 7-10 business days. I didnâ€™t grab a name but his contact number is 443-510-7761. I called Comcast to see if I could receive an earlier date (my husband takes online classes) but was unable to get anything sooner. Out of frustration, I cancelled the account. My husband said he could make other accommodations and asked to call Comcast and restore our services.
 On the 15th, I called to restore the service. I spent a 1h13m with the agent. I explained what happened previously to get him caught up. I let him know the agent I spoke with on the 10th gave me a great deal and I would like to take the offer if it was possible. He explained to me all the agent did was offer me a new account; I didnâ€™t understand because I asked to for my services to simply be transferred with the added features promised to me. I told the agent I would like for my bill to stay at $150 budget. So, he offered double play (cable and internet) at the $150 budget. We set an appointment for Saturday, June 20th and he also sent me a confirmation email.
 On the 19th, I decided to check my Comcast account to make sure there were no charges for my previous address. I saw a bill for charges for June 14th-July 13th. I called the billing department to get the issue resolved. She mentioned I needed to speak to customer resolution and they will take care of the issue. I was transferred to customer resolution but the lady mentioned she needed to transfer me again. I refused and I asked to speak to her supervisor; she hung up the call. I called back and the lady who took care of me this time offered her apologies. She explained to me the agent who took care of my cancellation deleted the wrong account. The only charges I would be billed for are the On Demand rentals totaling $8.98 after taxes, which will be mailed to my new address.
 On the 20th, I got a called from 800-266-2278 at 2:15pm to confirm the appointment. Then I received another phone call from 720-450-9278 at 3:14pm from a gentleman by the name of NELSON PEREZ
 from Comcast wanting to talk to about my recent cancellation. I told him thereâ€™s no cancellation and I have an appointment set up today from 2:30-4:30. I explained to him the frustration Iâ€™ve been dealing with. He then offers to provide me a $100 gift card, an offer (cable, internet, phone, and home security) at no extra charges to me at rate of 129.99. He would waive the installation and equipment fee for the home security. Provided me with my new telephone number . He offered me a new appointment date which I refused since I had already an appointment set for the day. He mentioned he would call the technician and update the work order to include the phone and home security services. He said I would receive an email within 24 hours. NO EMAIL!
 After the scheduled appointment time had passed, my husband informed me no one showed up for the appointment. He got in touch with Comcast and updated them about our situation. The lady who he spoke to mentioned NELSON PEREZ could not waive any security equipment fees which would be costing us $199 after telling him I didnâ€™t need it. But he insisted it was to compensate for their lack of service. She set us up for an appointment on Thursday, offered us free installation fee, all movie and sports channel, higher Internet speed free of charge for a year. She mentioned to my husband she will send an email. NO EMAIL
 This morning June 21, 2015, I checked my bank account only to find Comcast has charged me the for the cycle June 13th-July 14th for services Iâ€™m not receiving after being told I would be billed $8.98 for the On Demand charges.
 Iâ€™ve never dealt with such incompetency from a company EVER! I decided to report to the FCC in hopes of finding a better resolution to this lack of customer service, poor communication, inability to follow through, and false impressions. Thank you for taking the time to look into this complaint.

355761,Charge to my bill unknowingly,6/22/2015,1:14:07 PM,Internet,Columbia,Maryland,21044,Solved,No,"I was having problems with the internet service and I spoke with a representative about the situation and he scheduled a tech to come in 2 days to fix the problem. The tech came and apparantly the entire apartment building had the same problem according to the tech. a previous comcast tech installed a splitter behind the service door that needed to be removed for comcast service to work for our modem. He removed the splitter and all was good, not once did the tech show me anything paper or receipt for coming out or being charged $40 for anything to fix a problem that another comcast tech created. I pay them for the service why do I have to pay them again for fixing a problem that they caused to begin with. This really feels like a scam.

251830,Internet and phone pricing,4/23/2015,10:23:47 AM,Internet,Columbus,Indiana,47203,Closed,No,"The rate jumped. I tried to change it through the support line but the rates they quoted were higher than the online offers. I ordered the online offer. After the order was confirmed, I received an email that said I already had the services. I called to see what rates I had, and the support rep could not impact the online order or confirm what it was supposed to be and further said that the offer I was quoted earlier in the week was impossible as I was in the second year of an offer. In the end, I'm unsure of what I'm being charged, I have no idea what service I really have now and I don't have any idea how to find someone who can intelligently answer my questions. While I'm not one for a lot of government control, someone needs to do a better job regulating the internet, phone, and cable service pricing and contracting laws.

281798,Comcast bundled service,5/9/2015,12:44:18 PM,Internet,Commerce City,Colorado,80022,Solved,No,"I had Comcast Internet services/telephone,but decided to get their bundled service of, television and
 home security in March of 2015. I received a bill for $659 in April. My bill is usually $99 to $135. I
 called Comcast on April 10th and questioned why my bill was so high. I said I wanted items removed
 from my bill, such as the security and that I want a monthly payment to be no more than $200. The
 service rep said he removed them. We worked the monthly payment down to the price we agreed too.
 He got the overall bill down to $252 from the $659. This is what I paid at the end of April. However, in
 May,I received another bill for $754. This is after the $253 I paid for the April bill. I called Comcast
 they said they had no record of me calling in April to get these items adjusted on my bill. He is the
 kicker. I have proof and records that show that I spoke to Comcast for 31 minutes on April 10th. I told
 them I want everything removed and that I am closing my account because they are screwing me
 over. The said I would have to pay a $669 and $220 cancellation fees and the $754 bill. I only owe
 about $310 of the bill, not $754. I am writing a complaint to you because I cancelled a bunch of items
 and had a lot of items adjusted in April, yet they are still trying to charge me for them, on top of the
 installation fee for the home security. They want me to pay $1,643. How can I get this resolved?"
280486,Charged for equipment that I didn't have,5/8/2015,2:32:54 PM,Internet,Concord,California,94520,Solved,No,"Comcast charged me for the 2nd modem that I never had.
 Called them in January, they admitted mistake, however promised to return only 3 months of fees,
 even though I over-paid for much longer period. I've checked recently and they actually didn't remove
 it! So I called back and the same situation happened - they admitted their mistake, however now they
 promised to return only 3 months from now. This hasn't happened yet. So, I'm being overcharched for
 close to 2 years now and they refuse to return the money."
359962,"Comcast misrepresented their service area, then charged me for attempting to use it.",6/23/2015,7:47:44 PM,Internet,Concord,California,94521,Solved,No,"My wife and I were looking at a house to purchase at . in Concord Ca. It is on the edge of the city area so we made sure to call Comcast and other providers to make sure that we would be covered in the case of having internet service. Both of us work from home so it was quite a primary concern that we have fast and reliable internet, and Comcast was our current provider in the house we were leaving. The fact that they were going to work there was all we needed to hear, but just to make sure, we even called twice.
 A month or so after that, we have the house and we are getting ready to move in. So we call to get the service started only to find out, Comcast does not have service in that area. But it's only 7000 feet away. So they would call us back, and there may be a fee involved, but they can get us hooked up. They did call back, after I made numerous calls to them. They gave me the figure of $180,000 to run the line to our house. I was absolutely floored.
 So we couldn't possibly entertain that number. We have since delayed our move and had to seek out many other alternatives to get the service we required to move in, costing us many thousands of dollars in additional rent among other costs. I have had to take several days off of work to get the microwave wireless service set up. We now have a much lower speed service at roughly 4 times the cost of Comcast that we are forced to use, just to get some basic service. We would never have bought the house if we had known. We are looking to sell the house now very soon and hopefully we won't lose out on that deal as well. We were looking forward to having our own isolated place where we could work from home in peace and it has become an absolute nightmare.
 As if to add insult to this injury, Comcast has since informed me that I will be responsible for a $50 cancellation fee on my previous service because I have moved out of their service area. Despite the fact that I checked with them multiple times to make sure I was in the service area.
 Thank you for your time,

248736,Comcast Xfinity,4/21/2015,5:44:39 PM,Internet,Concord,New Hampshire,3301,Closed,No,"I have subscribed to a Comcast Xfinity internet service plan with advertised speeds of 25Mbps since December 2014 and am based in Concord, NH. I work from home and require frequent, fast access to a variety of data services. Although 25Mbps should be sufficient for my usage needs, I have found through Comcast's own testing software that I do not even get half of this advertised speed. Their own tools show I receive from 7-9Mbps speeds during non-peak usage hours. This is apparently not due to any type of connection limitation, as their technician verified the signal strength of the connection during their December installation visit.
 Prior to December, I was working in Tokyo, Japan where I had a residential fiber optic internet connection with 200Mbps connectivity for the equivalent of $40/mo. This makes Comcast's deficiencies all the more glaring and unforgivable. My return to the US has been a bitter experience, to say the least, in regard to the subpar communications infrastructure. It is even more insulting that I am paying more for less here. That, in itself, might be more tolerable if I even received the speeds I am paying for.
 It's alarming that Comcast wants to merge with TWC, considering their status as one of America's most disliked companies in terms of consumer satisfaction. Even if the merger does not happen, however, the reality for me remains that as a resident of Concord, I have no other choice apart from Comcast. Punctuating Comcast's disregard for service quality is the fact that they advertise a certain level of internet service and then severely under-deliver.
 At this point, I have no other choice except to approach the FCC with my complaint, with the hope of seeing some type of improvement from Comcast. At the very least, I think I deserve to actually get the services I am paying for.

 I am in receipt of a copy of the letter send to the FCC by Vanessa Fisher of Comcast on May 13, 2015. In her letter, Ms. Fisher states that ""I attempted to contact several times to discuss his concerns. Unfortunately, my attempts were unsuccessful."" Ms. Fisher goes on to state that in order to resolve the issue, it is necessary to speak with me directly.
 Ms. Fisher did indeed reach out to my home phone during business hours, leaving a voice mail with her contact information. Likewise, she also emailed me on May 11, 2015 with a summary of the matter and her request to speak with me. As I had been traveling at the time, upon return I attempted to reply to both Ms. Fisher's voice mail and email on May 19 and May 20, respectively.
 Neither of my initial replies received a response from Ms. Fisher. I once again attempted to email her on May 22, which again received no response. I once again reached out to Ms. Fisher on May 29 (this morning) to alert her that I have not received any response to any of my messages and that I am still suffering with connectivity issues. On the afternoon of May 29, I received the copy of Comcast's letter to the FCC and subsequently reached out again to Ms. Fisher by both voice mail and email to let her know that I will be making every effort, on each business day going forward to connect with her on this issue, to find a satisfactory resolution.
 This issue is not resolved and Comcast has yet to make any substantial effort toward its resolution.

358558,Comcast Does Not Deliver Service,6/23/2015,2:14:55 PM,Internet,Conshohocken,Pennsylvania,19428,Solved,Yes,"I've had Comcast ""high speed"" internet (up to 75 Mbps) for a month. Almost every time I try to use the internet (online gaming, video streaming, visiting websites), my sessions time out. When I called Comcast about this, they told me that they could detect no issues on their end. When I called again, they said the same thing but told me that they would send a technician out to determine the issue. They also told me there was a possibility that they would charge me for this, even though I was merely asking them to deliver service that they promised me on a contract. Of course, when the technician came, the internet was working completely fine and I was measuring decent speeds (download of about 25 Mbps). The very next day, the same issues I had before were happening again. Also, Verizon told me that they don't know if they can service my house (despite the fact that my neighbors across the street have them), so I literally have no choice but to use Comcast (as they've become an effective monopoly).

367651,Slow internet speeds on Comcast,6/26/2015,10:41:23 AM,Internet,Conshohocken,Pennsylvania,19428,Pending,No,"I've been a Comcast customer at this address for 4 months. I pay $39.99 per month for 30 mbps download speeds.
 There has been a regular and recurring issue with download speed that starts immediately following any bandwidth-intensive task (such as streaming a movie on Netflix, downloading a large file, connecting to a VPN, etc). It happens at least 5 times per week.
 After a bandwidth-intensive task has been completed, internet speeds are slowed to a crawl for a period of about 10-30 minutes. It is so bad that simple web pages do not even load, and no devices on the WiFi network are able to connect.
 My girlfriend and I call it our ""Internet Time Out,"" as if Comcast is punishing us for using our service. Once the ""Time Out"" is over, we are able to connect again at normal speeds.
 It is incredibly frustrating to be penalized for simply using our internet normally. It seems like Comcast is purposely throttling internet usage once their system notices that we are using a greater amount of bandwidth than simple web page viewing.

302833,Comcast service,5/22/2015,7:59:52 AM,Internet,Conyers,Georgia,30013,Solved,No,"I pay upwards of $150.00 / month for the last 11+ years. I have never seen lack of service and
 disregard for providing same in my lifetime, until NOW. I have had an ongoing problem with
 broadband over the last 2 years sporadically, until the last month when I've called numerous times
 regarding lack of internet service (intermittently), particularly when I've been working from home and
 blaming my work CITRIX (when in fact it wasn't). Comcast has been down most of this past week but
 they've not notified ANY CUSTOMER that it will be down, the time frame for same or when it will be
 back up. I've exchanged modems which went bad, I've called stating I have no phone service (as I
 have the internet, television, phone - or maybe NOT). I've had to take my cell phone to bed with me or
 charge it in my car to be sure I don't lose that overnight! As I live alone, this is the most maddening of
 situations and what I'm getting is (Wednesday 5/20/15) they'll schedule a technician to come out on
 the 29th???? REALLY? I even had a second person I'd called (after the first one told me someone
 would call me back in 30 minutes and after 1.5 hours) tell me that service in the entire area where I
 live was down but the first person didn't tell me this - I could have gone in to work and been there but
 I waited for their call. They offered me $20 and stated they would note it so I could get ""credit"" which
 has NEVER HAPPENED. REALLY? I make $40/hour and lost time because of it! I want something

361815,Nonsensical Raise in my Internet Bill,6/24/2015,1:00:32 PM,Internet,Coral Gables,Florida,33134,Solved,No,"My internet bill was recently raised by $20/mo. I do not understand why I should be charged more by my ISP for the same exact internet service I received for a year. If the service in question can be afforded to me and others for a set rate, why then should that rate be increased for no reason? I've attached documentation of the discrepancies in my billing. Although I've received the same exact services over the last 3 months (Xfinity Internet Package, HBO), the billing of these services constantly fluctuate. This is essentially like raising the cost of a toll on a highway, except there are no inflationary reasons given as to why it's suddenly more expensive, it just is. What I pay for internet doubled and ISP's shouldn't be allowed to raise your rate by such a significant amount, especially with no explanation as to why beyond ""your introductory period has lapsed."" This shouldn't be allowed. Thank you.

215011,Comcast service billing,4/2/2015,5:13:30 PM,Internet,Cordova,Tennessee,38018,Closed,No,"I was charged for a service call to my house. The technician made a repair to a line a previous technician botched. Comcast has said that the charge is valid, and I've asked to speak to a supervisor to contest the charges. Each time, I was told that I'd receive a call within 24-48 hours. No one has contacted me. They have told me that someone called. I did not receive a call or a voicemail (my contact number is my cell phone) I've called six times and tried over chat and the charges still stand. I have not spoken to 1 supervisor over the phone. A supervisor addressed me over chat, but in the end he/she said that they are unable to help me because they are over sees and that I need to speak to the local office (which I have tired numerous times). I've explained that the repair that was done was for something their previous tech did, but I can't seem to get through. I am paying monthly for a service. From October until this last visit to my house my internet was intermittent. It works fine now but I dont agree with the charges and would like to speak to someone that will understand why I am contesting it.

243443,Comcast Runaround,4/18/2015,10:42:01 PM,Internet,Cordova,Tennessee,38018,Closed,No,"I moved in February to this address, and, after having good service with Comcast in the past, decided to move my service, as well. On February 9, 2015, I spoke with a Comcast Representative, and she arranged to have my service moved, with a technician coming to hook it up at the new address on February 11th. That technician did not show up, and we rescheduled for a week later, on February 18th. That technician also did not show up.
 I have now had a series of appointments (a total of 12), including four that have been rescheduled without my knowledge, and only three that actually showed up. The first technician could not hook up our system due to weather. The second actually did hook up the system, but left it running at a less than optimal rate, because of temporary wiring that had to be put in. The third technician came to replace the temporary wiring, but diagnosed a different problem with the wiring, that required a contractor to replace. He scheduled an appointment for the contractor to do so (which has a 12 hour window, much too long for someone who works to have to be at home waiting for someone who might or might not show...)
 That appointment was scheduled for today, however, sometime between me speaking to Comcast at 8:30 this morning and again at 6:00 this evening, the appointment was rescheduled again without my knowledge.
 After 2 months and 7 days, I still do not have working internet service, I am paying them $90 a month, and have spoken to them on the phone a total of 46 times, with no results.
 Were it not for a lack of options that fit our needs here in Memphis, I would have cancelled this service long ago, and gone with another provider.

360340,Cruel and Illegal Practices - Comcast,6/23/2015,10:19:20 PM,Internet,Cordova,Tennessee,38016,Solved,Yes,"Originally when we moved to Memphis, TN from our previous residence we signed a contract with Comcast for 105Mbps Internet (no data cap). It was expensive but justifiably useful. Our household has a family of 5, all heavily connected to the internet be it for work, school or leisure. Modern high-school and college courses require mandatory streaming of supplementary lectures online, the download and upload of large assignments (from film to engineering projects), download and sharing of books/notes and more. We were shocked when Comcast upped our monthly bill in 2013 and instituted mandatory data caps with no option for us as a consumer to pay more to avoid caps (instituting usage based billing on a renewable resource). 300GB a month is an impossibly small amount of data for the average family to survive on and directly impacts how we utilize our 105Mbps of data. Please stick with me while I explain.
 Comcast is allowed to sell us 105Mbps of data-rate a month but footnote a cap. Bandwidth is a measurement over time, something not used in a moment of time is effectively wasted.
 105Mbps with a mandatory cap of 300GB a month means theoretically Comcast is selling us about 7-8 hours of internet a month. They should not be allowed to misrepresent 8 hours of maximum theoretical internet time as 105Mbps of data transfer speeds per month at the price they quote me. This is obviously not a realistic number as generally we have about 50% real-world overhead for LAN with no bottlenecks. So we'll say 12 hours of data a month.
 Now just assuming the above alone we are also being charged for the 10% of overhead all internet processes are subjected to (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Performance/Nagle/summary.html) which is actually part of the Official Protocol Standards (STD 1: http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2001.html) but our bill does not reflect a 10% grace, we are charged for physical limitations of reality.
 Frankly though, no one will ever agree to accurately advertising your service in this objective manner so I pose a more logical alternative.
 If one has a 300GB data cap, and is purchasing internet, the ISP should be barred from referencing these false data rates.
 300GB a month is 300GB divided by 30 days = 10 divided by 24 hours = .41667 divided by 60 minutes = .0069444 divided by 60 seconds = about 116KBps.
 Comcast is illegally calling my 105Mbps package broadband when in reality (per usage based billing) I am only receiving 116KBps monthly allowance at a sustained 24/hour usage (remember, bandwidth is a measurement over time, so they cannot assume I'm not using the data 24/7 in an advertisement).
 116KBps is not broadband as classified by the FCC. It isn't even close, and based on my monthly bill it should be downright illegal. I don't have any options for Broadband where I live. Comcast is allegedly the only one in my area. But math does not lie, and proves that they are wrongfully advertising what I pay for (105Mbps/300GB) as broadband when any rational state-educated human can see this is not the case.
 Comcast claims the data cap is only for Memphis as well, that is what it says in my contract, but I live in Cordova and am still subjected to this malicious and downright criminal practice. I plan to also file advertising complaints with the FTC for this as well.
 Please FCC, bar ISPs from being able to call capped plans ""broadband"" and require by law accurate description of what the customer is purchasing much like in the AOL days when you purchased ""hours"" of internet because that is effectively what Comcast is selling me.
 The only ethical and moral thing to do is advertise as theoretical hour usage per month (which will turn away all customers) or truthful bandwidth per month based on the cap you pay for (in my case 116KBps).
 Networks should never be allowed to cap it as a resource like oil. Quality of service management like peak hour throttling is more than reasonable but data caps are stifling innovation and bleeding the American family dry. Don't let them pillage what the United Nations called a ""universal human right.""
 Can you imagine an America where the FTC allows the auto industry to sell a car capable of 40MPG but only the car can only travel 40 miles a month, and the rest of the month the car has to sit in the garage or the driver is charged exorbitant fees to travel.
 Please FCC, do the right thing. Help us out from under this data cap or at least force Comcast to adjust our billing based on the REAL data transfer speed they sell us, 116KBps.

222682,Comcast agent lied about service upgrade,4/7/2015,6:31:03 PM,Internet,Corvallis,Oregon,97330,Closed,No,"While making some minor changes to my account on the phone, an agent tried to upsell me on Comcast services. I clearly declined them. As the phone call was ending, the agent asked me to confirm that I had agreed to the upsell. Again, I declined and asked for it not to be added to my account. Later that same day, checking my account online, I see that the agent made the account change anyway, regardless of the fact that I clearly declined it multiple times. After a short promotional period, this would have increased my cost significantly.
 Only after going through the lengthy support process a second time did I get this change revoked.

360800,Unexplained Billing,6/24/2015,3:17:38 AM,Internet,Corvallis,Oregon,97330,Open,No,"An unexplained Comcast bill exists as unpaid on my credit report. When contacted, Comcast has no history of any such unpaid bill. Comcast has yet to remove this alleged unpaid bill from my credit report. You would think they would bill me directly since I am a current paying Comcast customer -- if the bill did actually exist.
 Secondly, when making a personal inquiry at Comcast's office locally, Comcast officials are unable to explain why my bill is higher than other customers with the exact same service. While I pay close to $80 a month for JUST internet service (I don't have any TV, phone service with Comcast), other customers pay closer to $50. This is taking into account promotions and offers that extend for roughly 6-12 months. When comparing customer bills that have extended beyond the promotional offers (such as $20 off for 6 months), I seem to pay more. I have yet to get an explanation as to how they arrived at $79.95 a month.

I have called countless times to report the issues to them and have them troubleshoot the problems. They replaced my modem 5 times since I have signed up and have sent out two technicians. My internet data speeds and performance have never lived up to the outlined performance standards Comcast publishes for more than 30 days. Finally in late May I was transferred to retention where a representative made some additional adjustments to my account and replaced my modem again. I continued to have issues with performance and reported them to their tech support group in early June, since then the performance has lived up to their commitments (not been 30 days yet). Today I received a bill for $190.14, at no point did I authorize my bill to increase as a result of them resolving my issues nor was I ever informed of an increase. This is the second time they have added fraudulent charges to my bill. I expect the $190.14 to be credited to my account, the billing to be corrected back to the normal $45.71 (taxes included) it was over the previous months, and a $150 credit to be issued as a result of the ongoing issues and poor service.

That is correct, one thousand two hundred dollars to run a cable from a pole to my house. That would have cost me $1900.00 if I hadn't negotiated and talked them down. Additionally, they charge a 10 fee (part of the $76.95 bill) for Wireless Gateway, when I am running my own wireless off of my personally owned router!

 I would like to add more information to my complaint. I am in a monopoly area for COMCAST (XFINITY). No other providers are in this area, which I am sure is why I was required to spend $1200 in order for my cable to be installed initially. Additionally, I am paying $66.95 a month for the ""Performance High Speed Internet"" deal, which is a 25MB download connection ONLY with no TV channels, and another $10 on top of that for Wireless Gateway service. This seems extreme as this is not even close to their ""Starter SurePrice Double Play"" package which has a 50MB service and includes 140 TV channels for a mere $13 more than what I currently pay. Also, to get my Internet service from COMCAST, I am REQUIRED to have a Voice or TV subscription as well. Why is there no option for a true high speed 50MB download connection from them that doesn't include some form of TV subscription? They are bundling all their internet services and requiring TV or Voice subscriptions to artificially inflate their subscriber cable numbers. I would definitely purchase an internet only plan if it was offered and affordable.

360214,Comcast Internet is unbelievably slow,6/23/2015,9:33:15 PM,Internet,Crest Hill,Illinois,60403,Pending,No,"I pay a ridiculous amount for Comcast Internet and cable each month, and It doesn't work about 40% of the time. When I'm streaming Netflix it cuts out. Using wifi on my phone cuts out all the time. I then spend more time unplugging and trying to restart the router over and over, and half the time that doesn't even work. So I pay 115$ a month for it not to work more than 40% of the time.

273147,Comcast Refuse to Refund Rental Fee made in error,5/5/2015,9:42:35 AM,Internet,Crofton,Maryland,21114,Solved,No,"Complaint: Comcast has been charging me a $10 monthly router rental fee, when I use my own.
 History: When I started service with Comcast on 06/01/14 I notified customer service and verified with
 the installation technician that I would be using my own device and would not need to rent a Comcast
 device. I called a week after installation to verify automatic payment and paperless billing and was
 told that I would not be charged for rental.
 20 March 2015, I called Comcast to downgrade my service and review my account. After being
 denied a downgrade I was notified that I was also being charged a $10 rental fee since I upgraded
 service in September 2014. I was frustrated with the customer service representative after being
 refused further information on my account and details on why I couldn't downgrade service. I
 requested to be transfered to a supervisor. The supervisor was empathetic and wanted to ""look into""
 negotiating a bundle packet to suit my needs and also remedy the rental charge (from September
 2014). The supervisor gave me a ticket number and said that they would call a week later. I waited 10
 days and called back to see what the issue was. After speaking with 3 different customer service reps
 I found out that a ticket was never submitted to refund me the rental fee or downgrade my service.
 Another disappointing discovery was made during that phone call. The customer service rep notified
 me that the rental charge has been on my account since I started service June 2014. I tried to speak
 with a supervisor again to reveal any further miscommunication but was told to wait a few days for a
 supervisor to call me back. They never did and since then I've called Comcast several times to see
 about a refund and downgrading my service to basic internet but was quickly told to wait patiently.
 While I've been waiting, I'm paying for a bundle service that I've requested to be downgraded from
 because I can't afford it and I still haven't received a full refund for their error.
 My request: Have Comcast refund me $120 for the rental fee and downgrade my service to my
 original basic internet plan for $39.99/month."
359243,COMCAST,6/23/2015,4:27:05 PM,Internet,Crown Point,Indiana,46307,Solved,Yes,"Let me start this out by saying that my experience with comcast started out easily enough. My roommate and I decided we wanted to get high speed internet of our own, as the current internet was too slow. So we called up comcast to get a deal on 125/125 Mbps internet and cable. The deal was for 99 a month, a bit steep, but fair enough. We were told that there would be no other fees, that this was what we would pay per month. Knowing comcast like we did, we knew this wouldnt be the case as we found out when we opened the first bill which was upwards of 140 dollars.
 Fast forward to us moving to a different location, about 20 minutes away. We called to setup the move and they were happy to do so. They informed us a tech was required to install the new equipment, which was a 30 dollar fee. We told them we didn't need a tech to plug in the modem, we could do it ourselves. They agreed and cancelled the technician. A few hours later, we received an email from Comcast showing that a tech would be here and telling us of the 30 dollar fee. So, back to the phones we go to talk to comcast and get this figured out. After 2 hours and being transferred to 4-5 different people, we got the tech canceled, or so we thought.
 We moved and brought our equipment with us, it's supposed to be plug and play. Well, our internet worked, but not our cable. We are in the process of moving, so we wait a few days to call them and inquire, hoping it will solve itself. We make the call to Comcast and after 3 hours and who knows how much more transferring, we find out that not only did they cancel our tech, but they CANCELED OUR SERVICE ENTIRELY. Not a big deal they tell us, they can rebuild the account from old bills and get everything going again. They say they will call us at 10 that night, and of course there was no phone call. We call the next day to find out that the tech we talked to the night before was wrong, they can't rebuild the account and since what we had was a promotion we can no longer get that price for the package. So now we have to pay 5-10 dollars MORE because Comcast is terrible at what they do, but there aren't any comparable competitors in the area for internet, so what choice do we have?
 So we agree to this reluctantly because we have been on the phone for HOURS and are getting nowhere with anyone. So fine, we have internet and cable, but we need NEW EQUIPMENT. OF COURSE!!!! So they send us this new equipment, we have it a few weeks and notice our internet speed is not even close to what it should be. Call comcast to find out why, turns out they sent us the WRONG EQUIPMENT. So now we have to take this equipment and go to a comcast retailer to get NEW equipment. So now we pay about 145-150 dollars a month for cable and internet, for which we don't even get half of the speed we pay for most of the time and it goes out intermittently. Can you believe they actually tried to tell us that it's normal to lose over half of our speed constantly?

362056,Issues with Cable and Internet Packaging Unfair Prices,6/24/2015,2:05:57 PM,Internet,Crystal Lake,Illinois,60014,Open,No,"My only available broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I asked to remove cable television from my service package. Initially, I was ""forced"" into taking a package when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription to keep a low rate. Originally it was supposed to last for a year (it only lasted for 6 months and I had issues with billing being incorrect and charging for the â€œblastâ€ part of the internet service). This package was 50 dollars a month. Internet service on its own was over 60 a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and have rarely watched cable television.
 When I moved a year later to a different city in the same area, my price had increased to 70 a month. I called in and was told that the charge to install service at my new place was 40 total. I agreed since there was no way around it; someone had used Comcast in the past 5 years but they said the lines were disconnected (they werenâ€™t according to the tech who came out). Due to the fact that I had both internet (which I own the modem and router) and television through them, Comcast billed me 40 per service (total of 80). When I called in, I was told that no one there could take off the second charge even though it could be proven through call logs that I only agreed to 40 total. I was offered a reduced rate of 50 a month. I accepted and then afterwards they mentioned that theyâ€™d have to change my television service from ~45 channels down to basic local (the same ones I can get in HD with an OTA antenna). Since then, I have not even hooked up my cable television box.
 There were three new charges on my bill for Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax after the 4th month. Since I didnâ€™t agree to these charges, I had to call in and fight with them to get it taken off. After the 6th month, my bill went back up to where it is now (70 + taxes and fees). I have called multiple times to try to get my bill back down to the 50 a month a bunch of neighbors in the same city have paid for longer than Iâ€™ve lived out here. Since I have the lowest tier of television, they say thereâ€™s nothing I can do until I reduce the speed of my internet service. Even then, if I drop to half the speed I am at right now, it would only take off 5 a month. In fact, if I take off my cable service they will increase the price to over 75 a month.
 Normally, Iâ€™d be okay with an introductory offer going away, but at every turn I have been jacked around by Comcast. I have even tried going through their â€œexecutive service departmentâ€, and their normal lines via phone, via chat; all of them ended up with them stating that any change to my service will cost more. Then I have a new â€œfree offerâ€ on my bill that they very explicitly know I will not use. The amount of time and effort Iâ€™ve made to rectify my bill and service every 3 to 6 months is abhorrent.
 So my question becomes why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want or need.
 My other belief is that if you donâ€™t have services or products that have huge profit margins for them, then they are unwilling to deal with you. Case in point, I own my own modem and router because in my professional experience their hardware is not up to par. First itâ€™s locked down so certain tweaks such as changing your wireless channel cannot be done. Second, they have turned on wireless sharing so that their modems broadcast a network from your home without your knowledge for their other customers. On top of owning my own modem and router, I donâ€™t need cable so I donâ€™t subscribe to HBO or any premium channels like that. I donâ€™t have phone through them, which is a very very cheap thing to implement on their end but they charge a lot of money for the service and the equipment needed (compare to a service such as Ooma where you buy a box once and then you only pay regulatory taxes and fees each month. In a year itâ€™s less than 10 a month). So because I basically just want good, fast broadband internet I am paying way more than I should to subsidize their other customers.
 They also uphold unfair billing practices by attesting that â€œnewâ€ customers and â€œretailâ€ customers are different people. When a person down the street from me hands me their previous 2 years of bills and they show the same speed internet I have without cable for 50 a month, but Comcast claims that I cannot have the same price for the same service, I believe that is unfair. Right now, in my current market, I could get 50% more speed for 50% less price. In other markets where Comcast has competition, they have dropped their prices or increased their speeds for the same price, separate from having cable television.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

Now that I am wanting to start to work from home and the kids need internet for school, I am in the need of high speed internet. Our neighbor that is aprox 800 ft away does have Comcast. Comcast again today said that they can not provide to my home due to the distance. Is there any other action that I can take?

308341,Monopoly and Deceit: The 300GB Data Cap,5/26/2015,8:18:32 PM,Internet,Cumming,Georgia,30040,Solved,No,"Comcast has changed their billing plan from unlimited data to a 300GB cap (+$10 for each 50GB over
 the cap that you use each month). In their FAQ about the change, Comcast stated, ""In all of our trial
 markets except Tucson, the data amount included with all XFINITY Internet tiers was increased from
 250 GB to 300 GB per month"". That is a lie. It was not increased at all; we have gone from unlimited
 internet usage to capped. This takes advantages of families with multiple internet users, such as my
 family of 4. The marginal cost of unlimited vs 300GB data to Comcast does not justify the price it
 charges its customers. Comcast gets away with this only because of the uncompetitive, monopolistic
 nature of internet service in my area (Comcast only). It's exploitative and deceitful, especially to users
 who are uninformed and unaware that they are being lied to by their ISP."
308477,comcast xfinity home security service,5/26/2015,9:44:05 PM,Internet,Cumming,Georgia,30041,Solved,No,"This complaint is regarding Xfinity Home Security Service. I ordered the service along with Internet
 service, the company called ""Doblue Play"". Today, I found out that there is overcharge for the
 equipment installed for home security. I called Comcast first, after long explaination of my concerns,
 a rep transfered me to Home Security Service Billing Departement. I explained long story again but it
 was helpless. A rep and supervisor told me that I have additional equipments installed. What I
 cannot understand is that I never ordered addtional equipments. The technician should have installed
 the equipments which are included in the package I ordered. But, the rep said any how, addtional
 equipments installed so I have to pay for them. I told her that this is unfair. The reason is that first, I
 didn't order addtional equiments, if there must be addtional charges, the technician should have
 explained to me. When I order the service is the service I wanted. Not mor than that. Now, I have to
 pay for something which I didn't order at all. I don't know why the technician installed too many
 euqipments and didn't explain about the addtional charges. I thought those equipments installed
 were all inclued on the service package I ordered. When I signed on the contract, I wasn't that much
 aware of that there were additioan equipments. I just made sure that if theire were any other charges,
 the tech said no, just need to pay $299 installation fee. That's why I signed on the contract.
 Sencond, Comcast didn't show those charges on the first bill. If Comcast shows those charges on
 the first bill, I would have canceled its servie with 30 day money back guranteed. They show the
 charge on the 2nd bill which generated exactly on the end of the day of 30day money back gurateed.
 So, the supervisor of Xfinity Home Security Service Billing Department said that Sorry, but I have to
 pay for addtional equipments. I told him that please take the equipments back then, He said "" it's all
 yours"" . Nope I don't want it. I didn't even want addtional equioment. ""You guys installed what you
 guys wanted, and now, I have to pay for it?? it's insane."" He said, I can cancel the servise with $880
 penalty.
 If the technician mistakenly installed the addtional equipments, that's also Comcast's fault, so, the
 company has to correct it. Also, showing addtional charges on the billing statement after passing 30
 day moneyback gurantted period seems like deceiving customers.
 I cannot tolerate its lackadaisical attitude toward customers who trust big name of the company."
312553,Comcast bait and switch,5/28/2015,7:50:03 PM,Internet,Cumming,Georgia,30040,Pending,No,"On 05/26/2015 a representative from comcast called me and told me that they were upgrading my
 internet speed to 50MBPS and sending me a streaming device for $39.99. Today 05/28/2015 I
 received a cable box. I called comcast baffled because in no way did I agree to sign up for cable TV. I
 then asked if I could have the 50 MBPS internet and I was told comcast could not honor this price and
 that just the internet would be $49.99. I am somewhat baffled as to how comcast signed me up for
 cable TV without explicitly stating they were signing me up for cable tv. What is even more frustrated
 is that they practice unfair, dishonest, and unethical pricing given that they have a TRUE monopoly in
 my area. There is no other high speed internet service provider, so they can raise my rate and do
 whatever they please because I have no other options."
325844,"Comcast Data Cap in Atlanta, GA",6/5/2015,4:14:22 PM,Internet,Cumming,Georgia,30041,Solved,No,"I moved my family of four from Florida, where I had Comcast and an ""unenforced"" 250GB cap where I averaged 300GB/month, to the Atlanta suburbs where Comcast is limiting people to a 300GB cap before charging them $10 per 50GB for overage. The thing is, in the month of May we did nothing different than what we had done in Florida, and yet our usage is 689GB. Why? I can only assume it's because the Comcast service I pay for here is over twice as fast, so I can only assume that the streaming video sites we use regularly (Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube) detected the higher bandwidth capabilities and delivered higher quality content, thus using more of our bandwidth. This seems anticompetitive as my whole family must now worry about using competing video services, a fear that benefits Comcast, lest we get charged more and more and more for simply using the service we already pay handsomely for. All it seems I can do is write you and pray Google Fiber eventually makes it here.

358141,Data usage,6/23/2015,12:38:36 PM,Internet,Cumming,Georgia,30040,Solved,No,"I live in an area where Comcast is setting the overall limit on their Internet plans to 300 GB per month. This is a practice that was changed after I started service with them in 2012. Given that I have no alternatives for ISPs I had no choice but to continue to use Comcast. What I am finding now is that I exceed the 300 GB per month limit regularly and I must pay an additional $10 per 50 GB used beyond that point.
 When I contacted Comcast regarding the option to purchase an Internet plan with a higher limit than 300 GB I was told none are available. So there is no option for me but to pay the overage charge every month for the same service which I used to receive for $66.95.
 It seems that this practice of setting a data limit on a service where none existed before and then also providing no alternative has created a system where Comcast can charge whatever rate they want for their service. If Comcast decided tomorrow to reduce the limit to 200 GB I would be forced to pay more and there is nothing I could do about it apart from disconnecting their service entirely.
 Will there be some regulation in the future that would require ISPs such as Comcast to at least offer an unlimited data option for me to purchase?
 Thank you for your consideration.

361026,Extorted into signing up for multi-year contract,6/24/2015,9:35:25 AM,Internet,Cumming,Georgia,30040,Solved,No,"Comcast's data caps are clearly designed to push power users into signing multi-year contracts for their uncapped ""business class"" service. Since Atlanta's a captive monopoly market, consumers have no choice but to conserve bandwidth or agree to an even more one-sided agreement.
 My work requires all-day streaming conferences, which uses quite a bit of data. Coupled with teenagers using Netflix and Youtube, my supposed $99/mo Comcast bill often exceeded $160, after Comcast charged me for ""data overages"". Comcast charged these overages in 50gb blocks, normally at the end of the month. Often they would charge me for a 50gb block on the 29th, and I would only use 1-3gb of it before the 1st. Blocks do not carry over to the next month.
 Since Comcast has no real competitors in the Atlanta Metro, I had no choice but to convert to their ""Business Class"" plan. This service is identical to their Residential service -- same modem, same network -- except that it is unbundled from Cable TV, and is uncapped -- and locked me in to a multi-year contract. Worse, the terms of service require Mandatory Binding Arbitration, which prevents me from receiving a fair trial in the likely event of Comcast breaching their service agreement with me.

361262,Comcast Selectively Enforcing Data Caps,6/24/2015,10:46:11 AM,Internet,Cumming,Georgia,30028,Solved,No,"Comcast is enforcing a 300GB data cap in the Atlanta area, and it is leading to me paying an excessive amount of money to for ""additional usage"". $10 per 50GB block.
 First of all, I do not live in Atlanta. I live 34 miles north of the city perimeter, therefore I believe I should be restricted by the cap for Atlanta.
 Second, the cap is not enforced in all areas of the United States, and in areas where the cap is enforced, certain areas have higher caps than others. I should not be penalized and charged more to use the same network.
 Additionally, in order to keep my monthly rate down, it is cheaper for me to have phone service bundled with my TV and internet than it would be to have the same service without phone. I have never used the phone service and I do not plan to. This seems to me like a way for Comcast to be able to artificially inflate the number of phone service users in order to advertise a higher number of users.
 To summarize, I do not live in Atlanta and should not be bound to the city's data cap, and I should not be forced to take extra services that I do not use in order to lower my bill.

This past billing statement, they charged me $10 for going over this blatant usage cap, then providing me a $10 ""courtesy credit"" because they provide three grace overages in a 12-month period.

349925,Comcast complaint,6/18/2015,4:22:55 PM,Internet,Cupertino,California,95014,Open,No,"In April 2015 we saw a Comcast employee in a cherry-picker working on the telephone/internet lines behind our house (without notifying us). When he left, our Comcast internet was down. I called Comcast the same day, explained what had happened, and they said the earliest they could send someone to fix it was two days later. I was promised that we would receive a credit for the days we would be without service.
 When the Comcast technician came two days later, he explained that it appeared that the other employee had placed some kind of ""filter"" on our line, due to a ""leaking signal"" which he said would cause them to be fined by the FCC. He was able to climb up to the line and remove the filter, which immediately started our internet working again. He mentioned that the leak seemed to be on our neighbor's line, not ours, and could offer no explanation for why the filter was placed on our line nor why we were not notified of this in advance or at the time the filter was placed.
 Thereafter on our next bill, we were not credited for the days we had been without service as we had been promised, and in addition Comcast charged us an additional $70 for the ""service call."" I called Comcast and was promised that the $70 would be refunded and we would receive an additional credit of $20 for the days without service.
 On the next bill, we did receive the $20 credit but not the $70 ""service fee"" refund. Today, I called Comcast to inquire about the $70 refund and was told that in fact we would not receive the credit because the ""service fee"" was a valid charge. Comcast had no record of what had transpired during the technician's visit nor my previous conversations with their representatives in which I was promised to be refunded for the $70 charge. After escalating the dispute I was able to get them to agree to credit me for the $70. I have not seen this actually show up on my account yet, and until then am not confident that they will actually follow through since apparently they have no system to track the promises that are made to customers over the phone.
 My complaint is regarding the initial service problem we had, with Comcast basically shutting off our service without notifying us due to some vague ""leaking signal"" which was never fully explained to me. When the technician came out all he did was take the filter off and never said what would happen if the signal continued to ""leak,"" which apparently was bad enough that they had to shut off the signal in the first place. Then, I feel like we were basically held hostage by Comcast whereby they feel they can just come out and shut off our service arbitrarily, then charge us $70 to turn it back on! After arguing at length with their escalation department I was able to get them to agree to a one-time credit of the service fee but they were clear that any future calls would definitely be subject to the fee. They offered that I could subscribe to a ""protection plan"" for an additional monthly charge to presumably prevent this from happening, which appears completely unethical.

 There is no reason for Comcast to believe that they own the modem or that they gave me a modem. Their customer service is often rude, incompetent, and gives conflicting information on how to permanently fix this problem. Unfortunately, Comcast is the only cable internet provider in my area.

 sudden increase of overages and charges for Internet usage without any changes in our household
 Internet habits. When speaking with customer service, they say that they can confirm that our usage
 has increased, but cannot verify to us how they are able to measure this increase. We also find it
 interesting while researching this issue on the Internet that there are many other customers that seem
 to experiencing very similar issues of overcharges. And also during the same time line. I want my
 Internet provider, Comcast, to be able to give me a detailed accounting of my usage so I can address
 my usage in my household, or address the possibility that their measurement system is flawed. If it is
 on their end, I have then been overcharged hundreds of dollars over the course of the last six months
 alone. Thanks for you time -

321859,Comcast Data Cap Compliant,6/3/2015,5:19:36 PM,Internet,Dallas,Georgia,30132,Solved,No,"I don't believe Comcast's 300 gig data cap is fair or reasonable. I pay for 60 Mbps internet. With a family of 4, we are hovering around or crossing the cap every month. They are selling a product where I pay for a month, but at maximum bandwidth use I would use up my allotted data in less then 8 hours. In addition, I don't trust their meters. For example in January I was notified of an overage and charged for an extra 50 gigs. Being the last day of the month, I decided to download some steam games so I could at least use some of the 50 gigs I payed for. I have to be careful about when I download games I purchase as they can be anywhere from 1-25+ gigs. Despite using the data in January, it was applied to February and caused another overage. I think this issue could be be as big as net neutrality as the size of media increases.

361593,"Comcast Data Cap Limits, Lack of Competition, and Anti-Competition Business and Billing Practices",6/24/2015,12:15:00 PM,Internet,Dallas,Georgia,30132,Pending,No,"We are a technology driven family; both my husband and I telecommute on a regular basis in technology based fields. I am an online educator and my husband is a computer programmer. All four of our children are proficient in computer usage and have their own internet accessible devices for school and personal use. We are Comcast Cable Internet subscribers at one of the highest tiers and we are forced to yield to an unreasonably LOW and ridiculous data cap of 300 Gb per month for a family of 6. Unbelievably, this is the highest data cap of all of the speed tiers. Once we reach that data cap, we must pay $10 for each additional 50 Gb of data. In addition, because we use Apple devices nearly exclusively, we are throttled by a message from Comcast stating we are near our data cap each month. This message will throttle internet usage until you clear it by clicking OK. The issue is that the error does not display on Macbooks which is what we nearly exclusively use. We have to wait for Comcast to clear the issue on their end which is a hassle. In addition we also receive phone calls for when we near our data cap and when we have actually exceeded the data cap making the computer message really not even needed. If we had any other option for internet service, we would gladly look into it, however in our area there is NO competition for Comcast in terms of speed. DSL and U-Verse by AT& T are a joke and do not offer much better speeds than dial-up! Comcast needs competition; I have placed our city on the wish list for Google Fiber, but so far our city is not in Google's immediate plans for expansion. In today's society where HD online streaming is continually building a larger audience and becoming the norm, we are being punished by cable companies such as Comcast for reaching arbitrary data caps that they have created. We are cable cutters; we got rid of cable a few years ago and have never looked back. We love the freedom of choosing to subscribe on our own terms to Netflix, Hulu, and HBO. We rent movies through our Apple TV instantly and thus are using streaming for movie rentals as well. It seems as if Comcast is now instituting these data caps as a way to secure more profit and make up for the cable cutters like myself. Cable is going the way of the dinosaur, and for good reason. It is not fair that Comcast is forcing their customers to pay a penalty for Comcast' own refusal to keep pace with the changing landscape of digital media and society. To show that the cable company is aware of what they are doing, I asked a Comcast sales person just yesterday when they called to try to woo me back to cable, if the data used in watching their cable programs as a cable subscriber would count in my monthly data cap. The answer: NO; we offer our own streaming service and it does not count in the data usage as Netflix would. It is the SAME DATA! They are unfairly trying to force out competition by creating data caps to limit the streaming their customers use outside of their cable infrastructure. It is wrong and it is time for a change. The data caps are simply in place to net more money and serve no other true purpose. We need competition, removal of data caps, and the FCC to stand up to these unjust companies on our collective behalf.

The representative stated my monthly bill would be $142.99 moving forward. Several months later, I noticed that my bill is $206.00 monthly on average and not the previously agreed upon amount. Upon calling Comcast, I was told that the previously representative in November had not applied the program correctly resulting in the higher charges and that Comcast would not credit my future bills for the overpaid amounts nor will they apply the lower amount for future or current bills. After escalating the problem to a supervisor, I was still denied a credit for the agreed upon amount a Comcast representative offered to me.

Two different Comcast representatives told me my bill would not go up until September 2015 and that I could decide if I wanted to pay the new pricing come September, change my plan or cancel.
 However, My bill due July 3rd 2015 jumped up to the new price, which was a jump of over $20+ and when I called there was nothing they could do because the Comcast rep said that the computer reverted to the new pricing because my promotion ended in June 2015.
 I was misled by Comcast because I was told by two different reps that I had until September 2015. Yet when I called about the price jump, the rep said there was nothing they could do and I think that this was false advertising and unfair business practices. How could the Comcast rep not do anything to help me and solve this issue. I feel that Comcast just STOLE money from me by misleading me about my bill. I hope the FCC can do something about Comcast and all cable/internet providers about their false advertising and unfair business practices that hurt consumers.

242847,Comcast Unfair Billing Practices,4/18/2015,11:54:54 AM,Internet,Dania Beach,Florida,33004,Closed,No,"When I started new service, I opted to have a self-install kit which was suppose to be free. I was unable to install the kit because the previous tenant had disconnected a cable within the walls. Obviously, this is not an issue I could have fixed or foreseen. I called Comcast and they said that a installer would come FREE of charge to help with the issue. Once the installer came, he asked if I accepted the installation fee. I said no, because Comcast said it would be free. He said, he only gets paid when I accept the charge. I said that he can say whatever he wants, but that I would dispute the issue with Comcast. He was making me feel guilty for not wanting to accept the charge. I called Comcast and they said that they never agreed that the installation fee would be waived and they went ahead and charged me the $40. They said I could debate this charge with my landlord. I find these practices to be deceitful and I feel cheated by this company. I was forced to pay this amount, which they claimed would be waived.
 The fact that the previous tenant disconnected a cable within the walls was not my fault, nor was it theres. But I don't believe that as a customer, I should have to assume that financial responsibility. Especially because they're a huge corporation and I am a full-time student.

236425,Robber Barron Billing Practices,4/15/2015,9:59:13 AM,Internet,Danville,Illinois,61832,Closed,No,"Dear Sir or Madame,
 I am writing you to see if you can help me with a fair resolution to a problem with me leaving Comcast.
 I signed up with Comcast Business Class for phone and high speed internet in Jan 2013. My account number was . You will find that I have had an impeccable payment record with your company.
 Due to inconsistent phone service (we were without phone service to my dental office for total of 7 whole days during the 2 year period). When I signed up with Comcast Business Class, I was assured the service was very reliable (99.95% up time was quoted to me) and the equipment contained battery backups to keep things going even when the power went out. I had been in business for 30+ years before this 2 year period and had only been without phone service for 2 hours over 30 years before signing the 2 year contract with Comcast. I had called and talked with the Comcast Business Class people in Dec 2014 and they told me to wait until the contract was up to make the transfer. The contract was up on Jan. 27, 2015. I made arrangements with my old carrier and service was transferred back over on Jan 28, 2015.
 After the service was transferred over that day, I called back Comcast Business Class people, as they had asked me to do. I canceled my service with them, (Ticket # CR432450849) and since we no longer have a Comcast office in our hometown, he advised me that I had to take the modem and the router to 303 E Fairlawn, Urbana, IL 61801. Tel #866-594-1234. This is about 30 miles from here, but my wife returned pieces of equipment and associated wires and connectors to there location the next business day. (60 mile round trip). He told me we would get 1 final bill for the partial month. A bill arrived about a week later and we paid it in full. I thought all was taken care of and all was good.
 A month later, we got another bill for service and equipment rental (which we had returned and had not been using for over a month). We called Comcast and were told that we had not filled out the proper forms to discontinue service and were going to have to continue paying for another 2 months. They sent me discontinuation paperwork, which I filled out and returned that day. The person I talked to was totally unsympathetic with my plight and told me ""so sad, too bad. I did ask to talk to her supervisor, which I did and she told me that she would try to resolve this in my favor. I never heard back from anyone, and then got another bill the next month. (b) (6)
 The 2 gentleman from Comcast Business Class in Dec 2014 and Jan 28, 2015 had said nothing at anytime about needing to submit any forms or paperwork, or I would have done that clear back in Dec 2014 when I initially talked to them about my intentions to transfer service.
 As it stands now, I am being asked to pay out over $200 (3 months of unused and unwanted) for service that I never used. I only had a 2 year contract and honored it to the bitter end even though the poor telephone service caused my business to loose many thousand of dollars due the seven days of no phone service during the 2 year contract. I am now being asked to pay for a time period beyond my contract when I had gone through all what I thought were the proper channels and actions.
 I am writing you as a final nice action to try to resolve this in a nice and fair way. I ask that you stop the hounding bills that I am receiving and that you refund my payments for anything paid for service or equipment rental past the Jan 28, 2015 disconnect day.
 I will take this to several state and federal government oversight agencies if we don't come to a fair resolution of this in the next 10 days.
 I don't want to damage my credit rating and can imagine what will happen if I don't pay this in a timely fashion.
 Thank you for your time and attention,

376227,Fradualent claims,6/30/2015,10:05:38 PM,Internet,Danville,Illinois,61832,Solved,Yes,"upon signing up for Comcast service we were told that we would have the self-service equipment shipped out to us as priority mail. We did not receive the equipment until one week (7 days) later. When I told my wife to call the customer service line and let them know our displeasure the Comcast representative offered us a $30 dollar credit to our account. More than a week later and we still did not receive the credit, my wife contacted Comcast customer service via online chat and was told that our credit was not valid but was offered a $20 dollar credit. I feel that this is fraudulent because we were offered one thing and than once we never received what we were expecting we were forced to take a lesser deal.

 many problems, including a bill of $1,200 today. I;ve spent long hours on the phone with Comcast.
 I've been told that the bill was so high because two of my electronic bank payments were returned to
 Comcast. I printed my bank statements, called back Comcast, who then confirmed they gave me
 wrong information and took a payment of $438 OVER THE PHONE - I said ""make sure that's the total
 owed!"" I called back an hour later to confirm, and I was told something completely different! My
 regular bill is approximately $139 for TV and total with Internet of $289 I'm told. Now they took my
 $438 and still expect a balance of $792 - this is not the original Sales Pitch to take over ADT alarm

263641,Billing/contract issue related to data cap,4/29/2015,11:06:48 AM,Internet,Decatur,Georgia,30030,Closed,No,"In early March 2015, I signed up for Comcast's 105 Mbps Extreme internet plan. I was told that this plan did not have the data cap that is associated with some of Comcast's other plans. Based in part on the lack of a cap, the sales agent enticed me to sign up for this plan. Comcast now claims there is a data cap on the account and that it will be charging me for any data usage above the cap. I've reached out to Comcast multiple times about this issue. They claimed that they were going to pull the telephone call where I was promised a plan with no cap, but they have not followed up on this. Each time I speak to a representative at the company about the issue, they act as though they have no authority to deal with it. They have twice attempted to let me leave messages for supervisors, but each time the line went dead after the representative attempted to transfer me to the supervisor's voicemail box. Eventually I was promised that a supervisor would call me back about the issue, but this too has not happened. I have literally spent hours trying to get this issue resolved, and the resolution is quite simple. Comcast just needs to pull the call where I was promised no data cap, verify that the sales representative made that promise, and then remove the cap from my account. That call occurred on either 3/2/15 or 3/3/15. The resolution I seek is to have Comcast remove the cap, but it also seems appropriate that they would somehow compensate me for all the time I've invested in trying to fix their mistake, so far to no avail. Please contact me with any questions or if you need additional details. I can identify specific dates when I contacted Comcast about this issue, and I also have some online chat records related to this issue. Best regards,

 ease. These data caps are making it more expensive to do my job from home and from the office. I
 know that the law currently allows companies to do this, but I feel strongly that data caps should not
 be allowed. It costs the company a negligible amount of money to allow a larger or unlimited amount
 of data per month, and their capitalization on data usage is affecting my income and professional life.

368187,"Prolonged internet outage, tardy response",6/26/2015,1:30:10 PM,Internet,Decatur,Georgia,30033,Solved,No,"This complaint is regarding Comcast account #
 That broadband/internet connectivity is now a public utility is a fact of life. A prolonged outage and inability of the provider to provide resolution in timely and easy manner can affect consumer's personal and professional life significantly. Keeping this in mind as context, here is my recent experience with Comcast. I hope the Commission finds it as appalling, frustrating and unacceptable as I did.
 I lost my internet access on Tuesday, June 23 and called Comcast service number. After going through 4-5 rounds of ""boot your modem"" routine with the service rep I was told a tech visit would be scheduled for Monday, June 29. That is 7 days of internet outage - for a service that is akin to public utility nowadays! I told the rep that I work from home and this would cause great hardship to me. I was told there was nothing she could do and that I would just have to wait.
 I called Comcast support again on Wednesday, June 24. This time I had a more friendly rep who informed me (after going through 4-5 rounds of ""boot your modem"" routine) that Comcast had a 3 day policy to fix an internet outage and it was unacceptable for me to have to wait 7 days to get my service back. She escalated my issue (ticket number CR461446459) and said someone from dispatch would call me by the end of day the same day to schedule a tech visit. I did not get that call. However, I did get a call from Comcast's Indian call center - advance tech support or such - to troubleshoot and we again went through 4-5 rounds of ""boot your modem"" routine (and only that) to no avail. This person too told me I will have to wait until Monday, June 29.
 I called Comcast support this morning, June 25, 2014, to check on dispatch status. I was told by the rep that a ""tech had been found"" and I would be hearing from dispatch in an hour or so (ticket # CR476463709). That was about 5 hours ago, and nothing so far.
 I just called the Comcast support again. Most annoyingly, this rep again insisted on going through 4-5 rounds of ""boot your modem"" routine. This is a classic definition of insanity albeit institutional in this case - doing same things over and over again and expecting a different result. I had to escalate the matter this time to talk to a supervisor who told me he will get someone to my house soon but cannot give me a time.
 This is unacceptable. My internet is now down for the fourth day. My personal and professional life is at near standstill. All Comcast reps can do is to follow their ""boot your modem"" fetish and waste everyone's, including theirs, time. I need a tech to come asap and fix my internet access. An internet (b) (6)
 outage this long for customer subject to monopoly power and high prices should be unacceptable in our culture.

For the last approximately 6 months I am being billed $10/month for a modem lease when I own my own equipment. I have called 3 times previously and have been told that the problem is fixed and the charge will no longer be billed, the most recent on March 6, 2015 when Ticket #027815145 was opened and supposed to resolve the issue. Each time the bill continues to show the $10 modem lease fee including on my April 4, 2015 bill. I called today, April 20, to customer service and each time I got close to speaking to a representative through the menu system I was told that ""We are unable to complete this call at this time"".
 The modem in question that I am being charged for has been determined to be the modem for my home security system, the lease cost of which is included in the monthly fee for home security. I am being billed twice for it. My modem for internet access is owned by me, not leased.

313550,Deceptive sales tactics,5/29/2015,1:42:39 PM,Internet,Deerfield Beach,Florida,33064,Open,No,"On May 15th I called Comcast to report outages in my area, affecting me and a neighbor ten houses
 away. The outages lasted from one to several hours. The Comcast representative, Shirlene,
 informed a technician would be sent to the area though she had trouble understanding it was not just
 me. Shirlene provisioned my modem (I don't know what that means) as she said it had never been
 done.
 I lease my modem from Comcast and this modem is an upgrade installed on 9/9/2014 due to a
 Comcast bulletin. This modem provides WIFI service as well, necessary for smartphone updates and
 tablet computer use.
 Shirlene informed me that I was eligible for a promotional speed upgrade from 25 megabits per
 second to 50 megabits per second at no additional charge as I was coming out of my current
 promotional period (quite coincidental). I made sure it would cost me no additional money per month
 and it would not affect my television Internet package at all. Shirlene assured me it would not affect
 my television Internet plan or cost me any additional money.
 As of 5/15 my smartphone and tablet could no longer connect via WIFI. I received three
 ""confirmation e-mails"" of my new service with monthly billings ranging from $180 to $275, far in
 excess of the $163 on my May 2015 billing statement.
 After posting this complaint on the Xfinity Facebook page and stating I would file complaints with my
 state's Attorney General's office, the FCC, and the FTC, Comcast scheduled an appointment on 5/28.
 The technician and eventually his supervisor were here for 3.5 hours. Xfinity informed that the
 excess billing was due to Shirlene adding telephone service to my monthly plan which I did not
 authorize.
 The entire episode was a waste of my time in having to dedicate one-half day plus to trying to
 uncover the cryptic nature of the Comcast ""confirmation e-mails"" and why I was being charged so
 much and to discover the deception in my being slammed with a service I never requested.
 To-date I don't know if the fourth ""confirmation e-mail"" from Comcast of the ""final"" billing amount will
 be applied going forward, or how long it will last, but the promotional period as Shirlene promised me
 was 24 months and only 12 months is indicated in this confirmation e-mail...another deception."

His English was not good and I was not up for any more communication issues, I'm sick of this problem. Every time I asked for a US agent, he answered me with why I should let him do it and then finally said, ""I'll get you my supervisor, but I can't tell you the supervisor will be in the US"".

The service has been totally unreliable and required multiple service calls and equipment changes to no avail. The system has been unreliable and loses connection on a regular basis and has to be reset or requires technical support to resume monitoring. On the last attempt to repair the system I was advised there was an unusual situation with my home and the security system was destined to fail. It was at that time that I cancelled the contract and Comcast is now charging an early termination fee even though they are unable to fulfill their commitment in providing service. Multiple attempts to resolve this issue have been unsuccessful and tremendously time consuming. My justification for early termination was Comcast's inability to provide the services I was being charged for. They are unwilling to remedy the dispute and offer no alternatives. It is virtually impossible to communicate with anyone of authority because they will defer from one representative to another after long periods of being placed on hold. I have attempted to resolve this issue to no avail and Comcast has offered no solutions, therefore, I am either paying a $600 cancellation fee or essentially paying for a service that is not being provided as per the signed agreement.

360267,Unfair Billing Practices regarding Comcast,6/23/2015,9:55:33 PM,Internet,Delray Beach,Florida,33484,Solved,No,"To Whom It Concerns:
 In September of 2014 I opened an account with Comcast for Internet services. I found a promotional deal on their own website for 50Mbps Internet ""Blast"". I signed up after I had to argue that the deal was indeed advertised on Comcast. Once I had my account opened everything was okay up until I moved. In April of 2015 I moved to an address that still supports Comcast Internet. It is widely advertised online and TV commercials that moving your services with Comcast will be the ""easiest"" part of your move.
 However, once I contacted Comcast and notified them I was moving from Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Delary Beach, Florida I was told that I could NOT move my services. The easiest option was to close my original account (account # ) and open a new account, with a new account number. I thought this would be easy enough. The representative said that I could still get the same package as before but that my rate of $39.99 a month would not be an option to keep. I was forced to pay $49.99 a month for the same services just because I moved to another city in Florida about 20-30 minutes away. I did not believe this was a fair practice but my only other option if I wanted to pay the same rate of $39.99 was to add Cable TV to my plan. I did not want to include Cable TV as part of my package. I did not want to bundle and pay for a service that I would not use.
 So for the same amount of service I have to pay an additional 10 dollars a month or I must add more services that I do not want. Then after 12 months Comcast would increase my bill even more. I do not find this to be in the best interest of subscribers to Comcast. I have been very unhappy with Comcast and the level of service and how they are able to charge whatever amount they want because I have no other option than to argue with Comcast or just give in to their unfair billing practices.
 Sincerely,

I was ""forced"" into taking a package initially when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this package was 35 dollars a month. Internet service on its own without cable was 65 dollars a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and have just never watched cable television. For the past 3 years my bill has been slowly creeping upwards until it has now reached over 80 dollars a month for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

 We were trying to pay a bill through Comcast's website and for some reason couldn't login with our existing password and username. We had tried re creating the password but it required a security question that we never set up. We got a call from them and they told us that we owed them 190 dollars. Once we finally were able to get into our account to pay the bill there was a security question that we never set up with a ridiculously long password for it that we believe they set up considering that we never once made a security code with them or the codes subject. When we talked to this lady over the phone she was extremely rude asking us to explain our situation to her but kept cutting us off. We answered all her questions and tried explaining to her what we tried to explain previously but was cut off by her again mid sentence. Once we got the information that we needed to log in she asked my wife and I to and I quote ""be sweet the next time I call you"".

I have had multiple service calls which I am told I would not be charged for because the tech can see that it's a problem outside of my home. After these calls I got charges to my bill for them and the technician couldn't find a problem (the speed magically jumps up to 50 while they're here and drops back down after they leave) When I called about my bill they said they would reverse the charges and apply discounts to bring my bill back to what it was. ($54) so far it's been at $83 every month since then. No one is competent enough to solve the issue or fix my billing and I feel cheated both out of money for the service they agreed to provide and for the service I'm not receiving.

278557,Terrible Service and Ripped off by Comcast,5/7/2015,3:12:19 PM,Internet,Denver,Colorado,80238,Closed,No,"This is my second formal complaint about the same issue:
 I recently filed a complaint with the FCC, Thank you for reaching out to Comcast, I am afraid that the
 result was less than acceptable and it seems to me that they are being quite aggressive. I do hope
 this is not as a result of me reaching out to you. A Ms. Hamner, executive guest relations did reach
 out to me, but was completely unable to resolve the issue, infact she was under the impression that I
 had not cancelled my account, which I had, and that I had not returned by equipment and said If I do
 not return it she will charge me for it.... I had returned it. so many examples of them not knowing
 what is going on. They continue to threaten to charge me the cancellation fee, which I will not, this is
 going to affect my credit rating which will be extremely unethical of this company... below see a recent
 posting I have made via email to one of their managers...
 Zach,
 I am terribly frustrated with your organization. I recently cancelled your service due to the fact that
 you were not able to provide a solid internet line, and I was continuously having TV signal issues.
 After some investigation and not getting any replies, no shows from your technicians, I finally had to
 go to the FCC. Then I got a response from one of your account executives, Ms Lindsay Hamner, who
 replied to me a couple of times and there after refuses. What I was asking for was the cancellation
 fee to be waived, given that the service I was receiving was so poor I was using my cell phone to gain
 internet access:
 1. I have called many, many times and spent literally hours on the phone with your agents. On many
 occasions I was told you were not able to access my account to make the changes I needed,
 2. I Called for technicians and was given appointment times, and had no shows,
 3. I did have one tech come out who was not able to resolve the situation but told me to call to get a
 supervisor tech. I did.
 4. Your company offered again to send a technician, and I declined this and said its been months and
 I am still waiting and just want to cancel and move to Direct TV.
 5. I cancelled effective April 1,
 6. I called to cancel and it was cancelled, so they said, (after a wait of about 45 min),
 7. I was told someone would come to collect the equipment at a certain time,
 8. I took off work to wait for the person to pick it up,
 9. They did not arrive
 10. I called again and was told its easier to just drop it off at the service center, to which I answered I
 would have done that in the first place if someone would have let me know,
 11. I immediately went to your store in Denver to return the equipment. When I arrived I was told by
 the person at the counter that there was something wrong with my account, and he could not receive,
 check in the equipment, I said I need an official receipt. He called a supervisor who was not able to
 properly access my account, (something about a telephone issue?) I have photos of the screen to
 post on to the blog. After 75 min, they finally said they will have to write out a hand written receipt,
 and gave that to me. I knew immediately this was going to be a disaster, I had no choice but to
 accept it and hope for the best
 12.In reaction to me FCC complaint I received a very cold note from Ms. Lindsay Hamner, basically
 informing me that I am at fault and that they were not goint to waive the cancellation fee. She stated
 that if I do ever cancel I will be required to pay for the cancellation fee and if I dont return the
 equipment I will be charged in full for this, she also claimed I only called 2 times and thus its really my
 fault (Not quoted, but her message),
 13. Well the interesting thing is I had cancelled a month ago and returned all the equipment as above.
 14. So at this stage, you had charged me another month and not cancelled the account, nor did you
 have any record that I had returned the equipment.
 15. I told Ms. Hamner this, and she replied that she had had the account cancelled now and that I will
 still need to pay the cxl fee as I signed a contract ? Well this is terrible, i signed a contract, you did
 not provide the service, I cancelled, you did not cancel., I dropped the equipment off, you were not
 able to access my account, I was told by your executive customer relations that if i cancel in the
 future I will be charged a cxl fee and if i fail to return the equipment i will be charged for that, and I
 had already done all this.
 16. I have sent several messages since including leaving a voice mail.
 17 I have asked her to put me intouch with her boss, no reply from her.
 18. I have never been given an apology, just extremely hostile notes, I resent the implication that I
 would not return the equipment, I resent the inability for you to accept my equipment and I had to sit
 for over an hour only to get a hand written piece of paper,
 19. I sent all the photos to Ms. Hamner and she still claimed i will be charged, basically I am at fault.
 20. I am going to go back to the FCC,
 21. Frankly its only about $400 and it is no big deal to pay for it, in fact it would have been less
 expensive than the time I have taken to resolve this issue, but its the ethics of the matter. I can not
 believe that an organizatoin with such a lack of regard for ethical business practices is in business.
 I do expect htis issue to be resolved and I do expect to speak to someone who this Ms. Hamner
 reports to.
 Please help.
 Thanks

294253,Extremely slow internet speeds; Horrible support,5/17/2015,10:18:11 PM,Internet,Denver,Colorado,80209,Solved,No,"I signed up for a plan with 105 Mbps download speed, and opted to do the self-install package,
 which they promptly sent. However, the cable was disconnected at the top of the telephone poll (I
 could see where it was disconnected), so I called to have a serviceman re-connect it. I made it clear
 that the issue was with Comcast's cable, and unless they wanted me to climb the telephone poll
 myself, they would have to send someone to do it.
 - When the serviceman came, he wanted to come into the house to connect the cable, and I
 explained that I needed him to go connect it outside on the telephone poll. He seemed confused, and
 I found out that the work-order that was created turned out to be for a full installation - which includes
 a $75 charge. I told him that I just needed the line to be hot, and when he connected it, the internet
 light turned on on my modem, and I was good to go. But he still wanted to complete the Activation. I
 told him that I'm using my own modem and router, both of which are top-of-the-line, and more than
 capable of through-putting 105Mbps (Router handles up to 300Mbps, Modem handles up to 172Mbps
 - both are the latest model). He went back outside and disconnected one of the cable links on the
 side of the house, then came back to my front door and said he needed to look at my setup. I asked
 him what he had disconnected, and went to look on the side of my house, and he full-on sprinted to
 the side of my house to beat me there, and quickly began reconnecting what he had disconnected.
 He said he made a mistake, when he obviously disconnected a cable to gain access to my house to
 charge me for a full activation. I could not believe it. He was caught in a lie, and was very apologetic.
 I had him call his dispatcher, and that I wanted to speak to her. I told her what happened, and she
 said that the work order was for a full activation. I told her that was wrong, and that I just needed him
 to make the line hot, and that I'm good to go now. She promptly told the serviceman to leave, and he
 did.
 - Upon activating my connection, I immediately did a speed-test, with the representative on the line.
 My speeds reached 50Mbps - no more. I asked why I wasn't getting 105mbps, she directed me to the
 Comcast website speed test where the numbers showed higher than speedtest.net, yet still under the
 promised 150mbps. She asked me to reset my box so she could ""check"" something, upon reboot, my
 speedtest.net results showed 80mbps. She said it's the ""best they could do"" even after I reminded her
 I'm paying for 105mbps. Again, I was using a modem and router capable of MUCH higher through-put
 than 105Mbps, and I was sitting less than 4ft from the router (using the latest retina Macbook Pro).
 She said that if I find that my speeds are substantially less a week later, they could put a ""booster"" or
 something on my line. Not sure what this does exactly, but I decided to continue monitoring my
 speeds each day for a week.
 - After 3 days, my connection was topping out at 18Mbps, averaging at around 15Mbps. Again - I
 was paying for 105Mbps.
 - One week after the mentioned Mbps conversation was had, I called Comcast to see what they could
 do about my service. I was on the phone with a representative for 45 minutes asking why I'm not
 getting the internet I was promised, and how I could get anything close to that - making it clear that I
 would be happy with anything over 50Mbps at this point. He had no resolution for me, downplaying
 the effectiveness of the aforementioned ""booster"" and offering various actions I could try, one of
 which was disconnecting the coax cable from the wall and the modem, and flipping it (wall-side to the
 modem, and vice-versa). I literally laughed out loud when he said this. He ended up saying that the
 low speeds were attributed to the fact that I was using 3rd-party hardware (modem and router), and
 that I should contact the manufacturer. Even when I assured him that my hardware was much better
 than what Comcast would have rented me (for $10/mo), he said that the problem was probably my
 hardware. I finally told him that I would do a power-cycle, and when I turned everything back on, lo
 and behold, the speeds were back up to 81Mbps down, and 12Mbps up. I told him that these speeds
 were acceptable, and that I would continue to monitor to make sure they don't go down again.
 ===
 I am angered by Comcast hiring unethical employees who will disconnect a cable on the side of my
 house, to complete a faulty work-order, and thus charge me for a service I did not need or ask for. I
 am angered by Comcast for claiming to provide much higher speeds then they actually can deliver. I
 am a UI designer, contracting for 3 companies, working an average of 15 hours a day. I am shocked
 that I have had to go through such a headache to get decent internet service from Comcast. I can't
 imagine how many people are getting much lower speeds then they think they are, and who are
 paying all sorts of extra fees simply because they trust Comcast to deliver what they say they will.
 The reality is, unless you watch them like a hawk, and confirm and test everything, you will most likely
 be ripped off in one way or another. It is shameful that Comcast allows these types of practices to be
 a standard."

350389,Internet Speed Drops & Signal on Borderline,6/18/2015,7:09:02 PM,Internet,Denver,Colorado,80219,Solved,No,"Hello,
 Not sure if this falls into ""Speed"" or ""Interference"" but here goes.
 I have called Comcast multiple times regarding my internet connection dropping once a day the past month and a half and more recently twice a day this past week. Prior to the internet connection dropping everything was working fine and I haven't changed anything at all but all of a sudden my modem would state that it's connected but no connection would come through (confirmed this with a Comcast Technical support representative) so Comcast sent a Technician two weeks ago.
 Everything in my house wires, modem, cables are fine which the technician explained and went to check outside. He stated that he did something (didn't explain what exactly only to send a new signal) and hoped it wouldn't happen again (now this isn't very reassuring) he seemed dumbfounded by the situation and the explanation he gave me was ""All I can tell you is that this happens in Apartments"". Now this technician is a nice guy he tried to help me out but what upset me the most is, NO, this does not happen in apartments because prior to this month and a half of internet difficulty my service was nothing but exceptional for just over a year or so that I've been with Comcast. To me ""All I can tell you is that this happens in Apartments"" is an excuse and a poor one, he shouldn't be hopeful but factual.
 Now I really did hope that would fix the issue, but guess what? I did not. At all, made things a bit worse. Internet connection started dropping now twice a day which is frustrating having to power cycle my modem twice a day when I'm in the middle of something.
 I called Comcast tech support again to explain the situation and this gentleman looked into my modem signal log/history to see what's up and saw that my signal was just at the ""borderline of coming and going connections"" so I asked him ""What can we do here to fix this?"" the tech support said ""I can't do anything on this end""
 I really want this issue fixed as soon as possible. I am also confused about it since for over a year of service I've had with Comcast my connection never dropped every day like how it's been doing for the past month and a half.

I called Comcast and they said they would have to send a tech. They send a tech. He laughs and says ""I can't believe they didn't cut off your service. The line coming to your house is an older type cable and needs to be replaced. I say ok. So all in all, the tech replaces Comcast wiring and our service is restored. Later I get a bill, for $70 service call. I call in and request it be waived since the issue was with Comcast's equipment (wires) and not internal wiring or equipment. The first customer service person is not helpful and will not remove fee. I ask for manager and after much discussion and many attempts to get me to buy some sort of service plan for a $4.95 monthly fee, she finally says. ""The computer will not let me fix this"" The only way I can remove the fee is if you pay us the monthly fee going forward. And if you cancel the service agreement before 3 months has passed, the charge will go back on"". She also states that even though she is in the ""escalation dept"" That the computer has been programed to NOT allow her to waive the fee unless a customer signs up for the service agreement and associated fee. I refused. I was not going to be blackmailed into signing up for a service and paying a fee just to get a bogus service call fee removed. Since it was clear that Comcast executive management chose not to even give their customer service people the ability to fix this issue, I decided to write the FCC. I would imagine that literally thousands of people each day are getting these bogus fees on their bill. Some just pay them without knowing it because they are auto pay; some do notice and call in like me... and get nowhere... or worse are forced to pay for a monthly service agreement. And Comcast wonders why they rank at the bottom in customer satisfaction?? So here I am, 2 hours into my attempts to resolve this issue. What a waste of time and effort. I would like a bill credit for not only the bogus service call fee; but also my time . $500 should cover it.

I do not wish to have cable and have actually never watched television service since we moved in.

If I cancel phone and cable I will get a whopping -$20 discount and would be paying $100 for JUST internet service. In most of Europe and in other well developed nations Phone, internet and cable cost $50 TOTAL. To add insult to injury $50 in Europe gets you 3 times the internet speed! Yes America (The nation that invented the internet) currently is ranked 16th as far as speed for internet service goes. My complaint is that I shouldn't be paying double the price for a third of the service THAT COULD EASILY BE PROVIDED if the service providers weren't such money grubbing sleezeballs.

For the first few weeks streaming video was great, no slowdown and smooth. It seems that my usage has been 'too high' for them, and they have made it so streaming video has become almost impossible. It's choppy, slow to buffer, yet everything else works fine and my speed tests show my normal 150 MBPS speeds. There's no other answer other than they have started throttling my usage because I've been using too much data.

371318,Billed without service,6/28/2015,9:35:38 PM,Internet,Denver,Colorado,80250,Open,No,"I went into the service center at Belmar shopping center and spent a great deal of time discussing the different options because I was most concerned about the ability to have my TV connect wirelessly. The prepresentative at Comcast went into great detail about how their modem would be better and faster than my current provider Century Link. I decided to take the modem home and try it contingent on the representative stating to me directly that I could return the modem if I didn't use the service and would not be charged a penny. I told the representative that Century Link was going to increase the speed of my internet and that if it didn't work I would use Comcast. I took the modem home but I NEVER used it. I never used my Comcast for one single moment. I went into the Comcast center because they were billing me and the representative told me that a manager would call me because he wasn't able to take my modem back and issue a credit. He also told me that Comcast could not check if I ever used the service. When I asked for a manager the representative in the store told me that one was not available and it was mid day. I insisted that someone address the issue and he told me that a manager would contact me. A manager NEVER contacted me. Then Comcast had a third party service named Complete Recovery Corporation contact me. I spoke with Steven May and told him that I never had Comcast service and I was more than happy to return the modem but I needed my account to be cleared. I made several calls to Comcast to try to correct this and went into the service center more than once. I finally gave up because a manager NEVER contacted me as promised. Then last week I discovered that Comcast has placed my account with a collection agency and the collection agency has already reported the account to the credit bureau without contacting me. I discovered this when it was brought to my attention as I was applying for credit. Comcast also placed a hard inquiry on my credit file and they never asked me or disclosed to me that they were going to check my credit. I never used the service with Comcast. I was promised I could return the modem if I never used the service and not be charged. The representative at the service center refused to allow me to talk to management. Management never called me. Comcast did not resolve the issue when I contacted them over one dozen times about this.

309213,"Billed for modem rental for several years, Comcast refuses to refund under ""caveat emptor""",5/27/2015,12:54:22 PM,Internet,Deptford,New Jersey,8096,Open,No,"On May 15, 2015, I contacted Comcast customer service to set up a newly purchased modem on my
 account. The representative I spoke with that day noted that they would no longer charge us for a
 modem rental going forward. I asked her to look further into it, because I have never rented a modem
 from Comcast. She researched the issue and informed me that the billing error had been occurring
 since November 2009. She created a ticket to have the error corrected and our account adjusted
 (Ref# 029052678) and said we should call back in 5 business days.
 On May 26, 2015, 6 business days later, I followed up on the status of the request with Comcast
 customer service. The representative, Marcus, repeatedly denied that they would be able to confirm
 whether the error had occurred for that length of time, as their records ""only go back one year,"" which
 is completely inconsistent with what the representative I spoke with on 5/15 told me. Marcus also
 informed me that they would be refunding me for one month, or $6.45, of the overpayments, because
 it is my responsibility to verify that their billing is accurate. At that point, I asked to speak with a
 supervisor.
 When I finally reached a supervisor, I authorized my husband to continue the conversation. The
 supervisor refused to identify himself by name to my husband, and when my husband explained the
 issue and asked that we be made whole, the supervisor responded that two months would be the
 maximum refund they would offer and stated that it is our responsibility to verify the correctness of
 their billing practices.
 We have been on an automatic payment plan with Comcast for several years, and never noticed a
 significant enough change to warrant further investigation, hence our failure to review the bill
 thoroughly. However, we have always expected Comcast to act in good faith and bill us only for
 services that were provided, and not for those services they have not provided.
 Also, in reviewing their bill dated 4/21/2015 (see attached), I believe that their billing statements are
 intentionally deceptive. On page 1, the bill states that we pay $76.95 for our service and $0.70 in
 taxes for a total of $77.65. If I were to review my bill, I would see that page and assume that $76.95 is
 the cost of the cable internet service only. However, when I review the second page, that service total
 is $66.95 for the service itself and $10 for the modem rental. It stands to reason that reasonable
 individuals who review their bill on a regular basis might easily miss a charge such as this.
 Additionally, we note that their refund of $6.45 per month falls far short of the $10 that has been
 billed. At 66 months, $6.45 per month would amount to an overpayment of $425.70; $10 amounts to
 $660. The difference is very material to the average consumer.
 Please take action on this complaint and ask Comcast to make us whole. We aren't seeking anything
 more than we have overpaid them over the last five-and-a-half years, only the excess amount paid for
 services not received.
 Sincerely,
 (b) (6)"
217999,Misleading information given,4/4/2015,4:21:46 PM,Internet,Des Moines,Washington,98148,Closed,Yes,"I recently was reviewing my 80 year-old mother's bills and noticed that her Comcast bill included modem rental. I asked her why she was renting a modem when you can buy them at Best Buy, Walmart, etc. She told me that when she called Comcast and asked why her bill was so high in 2014, they told her she could not purchase a modem that supported both a phone/internet connection.
 I called Comcast today and after 79 minutes on the phone and various representatives, I was told exactly the same thing by Curtis. I asked to speak to a supervisor when I was told that my mother had been renting a modem since 2011 for $10/month. Four years of fees to rent something she could have purchased herself but because she is a Senior Citizen, she believed what they told her. I have a batch number for my complaint #DUJO0411 and Comcast assured me that they will be in touch within 72 hours.
 I find this reprehensible behavior to lie to customers and tell them they need to rent items they could easily purchase in the store.

Nonetheless without disclosing the Representative renewed our contract for additional 24 months without our knowledge.
 Yet again on 10/22/2013 we called customer service and all we wanted to do at the time is to add Basic Cable TV. Yet again, we were misinformed as to what transpires when adding a basic service. We were absolutely not disclosed that adding simple TV service would renew/add secondary contract .
 Moreover, while discussing the matter after words with several different business customer service representatives we were informed that Comcast Business does not offer nor support Cable TV in the residential house under business account, therefore it was never supposed to be installed; furthermore, additional contract was executed.
 Based on arguments listed above we file for:
 1. DEFINITVE TERMINATION OF CONTRACT #1 (Id# 6474396) from June 2013 to expire June 2015 WITHOUT ANY PENALTIES AND FEES.
 2. Since we were never suppose to be provided with TV at the Residential House and were not disclosed that additional contract shall take affect we file for TERMINATION WITHOUT ANY FEES AND PENALTIES OF CONTRACT #2 (ID#6871464).

I am so frustrated with this nonsense Comcast is a multi billion dollar company and they can't straighten out my internet and on demand service. Comcast customer service sucks! It is bad enough that I sometimes have to struggle to understand what most of their customer service reps are saying. Is there anyway you can light a fire under them? All I want is to receive the services I am paying for. In this age of technology the internet is a necessity for me and my family and we are all very inconvenienced.

It is bad enough that I sometimes have to struggle to understand what most of their customer service reps are saying. Is there anyway you can light a fire under them? All I want is to receive the services I am paying for. In this age of technology the internet is a necessity for me and my family and we are all very inconvenienced. I have already paid an extra $50.00 to Metro PCS for a hot spot connections in order to have the internet. HELP HELP HELP HELP!!!!!!! Please Please Please you are the only one who can.

306959,Unfair Charges and substandard service,5/26/2015,12:17:40 PM,Internet,Detroit,Michigan,48216,Solved,No,"Back in December 2014 - Feb 2015, I had called complaining of unacceptable latency to first hop on
 the Comcast network and outages occurring many times daily which made it impossible to work from
 home. Comcast agreed to send a tech out and indicated that I would be charged if the issue was on
 my end. Contracted Techs were dispatched a number of times and didn't find issues at my house.
 Ultimately they escalated it to a Comcast Engineer who fixed the signal repeater near on a utility pole
 my house and indicated to me after his work that my area is severely oversubscribed and that there
 was a plan to split my neighborhood. His work on the Comcast Repeater on the utility pole helped
 quite a bit but latency is still high and I get periodic connection issues. Ping times to the first hop (my
 local comcast office in my city) are varied from 30 ms to 3000 ms depending on the time of day.
 I've called a number of times to dispute the $140 charge for the tech visits mostly without success. I
 did at one point talk to someone in tech support who was able to take $60 off my bill as that was the
 limit he could take off without referring the matter to a supervisor. I've called since then a number of
 times requesting the remainder be taken off. I've been told consistently that a supervisor needs to
 call me back but nobody ever does. It seems to me that that there are institutional barriers to
 resolving billing disputes and I haven't been able to get this resolved.
 In addition, I find the level of latency substandard, the service inconsistent and customer service rude
 and unhelpful and certainly not worth the $80 per month that I'm forced to pay this local monopoly for
 internet service. My neighbors and I all would very much like to see this issue resolved."

My wife made a payment over the phone and our account in May 2015 of $393. The automatic bill system took and additional $400 in May 2015 for May's payment.

When we first signed up for Comcast we was told that our internet would be unlimited midmonth during our billing cycle we get a phone call telling us we have went over data allowance for the month. That the first 3 months that we wouldn't be charged and then three months later we get a bill for $300 saying we went over our data allowance. In the mean time we have changed things on our plan and are being charged a month in advance for each time we make changes never seeing what we paid for in advance for the prior time. Now, with that being said back to the unlimited data issue we change our plan and get more tv channels instead of using data to stream Netflix like we had been doing previously and they tell us that we can have faster internet with 100 more gigs of data. Then i get the phone call again we have went over data limits again and have not been streaming Netflix nor have we used the internet as much as we had in the prior months. So, I call Comcast and they say there is no such thing as a higher data package so now i have been lied to twice first saying we were getting unlimited data and then telling us there is no such thing as more data that all of their plans contain the same amount of data. I call several times to talk to someone about my concerns get connected to a supervisor and then i get hung up on once i discuss my issues with the supervisor. Our bill gets higher and higher every month with no rhyme nor reason of why. I am getting very discouraged and am not sure where to turn. I just feel like bills for $400 for cable and internet are a little absurd. If you need a tech to come to your house because something is wrong with your equipment you get charged an astronomical service call fee. I could just switch but then I'm under contract for a year.

 was no where near as advertised. I tolerated it for a week or two but it started to randomly crash
 every hour or so. This prevented me from doing the neccasary work I need to do so that I would be
 able to pay comcast at all. Also, I was recieving billing statements that weren't exactly trustworthy.
 Low and behold I called comcast to understand both problems. They had me on hold for times up to 2
 hours each day I tried to solve the problem. They continued to say that it was my problem for the
 lackluster internet. So, I try and be patient and I do as I was told would solve the problem and bought
 a new cable modem that they said would solve the problem entirely. Again, didn't work. I was forced
 to call again and remain on hold for a period of 2 hours waiting for a supervisor. I was told once again
 that there was nothing they could do but reimburse me for the days I didn't have any internet...20$.
 Now this concerns me because at this point in time I have been without internet for over a week and
 have spent up to 10 hours over the span of a week trying to resolve this issue. I have been hung up
 on and spent valuable time during work trying to figure out the problem, only to be told I am the

 I've had Comcast television, internet and phone service for almost one year now. Recently, I've
 had internet service outages consistently each day for multiple hours. I've called Comcast service
 every time my service goes out and have been told there is a ""severe outage"" in my area and that
 ""advanced technicians"" are working on the problem. This has occurred since April 28, 2015 to today
 which is May 6, 2015 (which as of right now still isn't fixed). The representative I contacted last night
 told me the outage should be resolved by 10:12 P.M. as of last night which was May 5, 2015. I check
 this morning and my service still isn't working and the out resolution date has been pushed back to
 3:00 P.M. today which is May 6, 2015. Now this is approximately the 7th time I've been told a
 resolution time and it has been pushed back. I pay over $150 a month for this service and I can't even
 use my own internet. The representatives have told me ""just use our Xfinity Hotspot coverage until we
 fix the issue."" And about 50% of the time their Xfinity Hotspot won't even work either. I've been hung
 up on, dusted off by multiple representatives just blaming my services on the ""severe outage."" I don't
 know what else to do. I'm fed up with Comcast. Most of the time, I can't even get a service technician
 out to my apartment for a minimum of 4 days. This issue has gotten worse instead of getting better.

 My billing stop date (or so I was informed during the call when I requested the disconnect) was on December 11th, 2014, one day after I moved out of the apartment.
 I made a payment to my account at Comcast on December 24th, 2014 in the amount of $20.31. I did so because the due date was the next day, and I never received an amount for the pro-rated amount for the 11 days of internet services I received in December. The pro-rated amount came to be $3.23, thus an overpayment of $17.08 occurred.
 I contacted Comcast customer service in January 2015 and requested a refund check of the overpayment amount, and was told the following (verbatim): ""Refund checks are automatically generated 30 days after a customerâ€™s hard disconnection date, not the stop bill date. You will receive your refund in the form of a check. It typically takes 4-6 weeks for the entire process to take place."" The hard disconnect date occurs a month after the billing stop date, and I believe my hard disconnect date occurred on 1/27/15.
 To date, I have not received any check or refund, and have had multiple inquiries into the status of the refund deflected over the last 4 months.

At this time I paid Over $300 to pay my account in full so we could start our new service fresh. Comcast never credited my account for the one month ahead billing of $163.00 for the previous service. I called Comcast on 4/21/15 to ask them to upgrade my service to Blast internet speed as of 4/21/15. The Internet speed was not responding when they looked at my current modem due to my outdated modem so I was asked to purchase a new modem. I purchased a new modem on 4/21/15 at Best Buy. I set up the modem and contacted Comcast to send the signal and set up the new modem on my account. I spent over 2 hours on the phone with Comcast with no solution. I was switched to 4 different representatives and placed on hold repeatedly. They are still trying to collect the $163 amount from me they are saying I still owe them and are not willing to send a new signal to my new modem until I pay for this bill. The $163 invoice is for my previous service of 200+ channels with HD and a DVR that I would have owed if I would have kept my 200+ channels. I returned all of the boxes to Comcast and switched to a $69.99 plan as of March 30th. I do not owe the $163.00 for April for the service I suspended on March 30th. I spent over 2 hours on the phone with Comcast representatives last night to try to fix the billing issue only to be sent to another automated service that asked me again to pay a past due amount of $163.00. When I spoke with the billing department, the lady on I spoke with said she was uncertain as to why this is happening because my bill is current. This delay of internet has caused problems with my job. I am required to complete work from home and I am unable to remote into my employer to do this. I do not have a problem paying for the service that is being provided to me, but I should not be kept from my internet service when I am not past due on my account and because they are trying to collect more out of me than the service that is being provided to me. No one took the time to try to recalculate my new bill and service. All they were worried about was this amount that was showing up for $163.00 that I do not owe because it was for my previous service that if I would have kept, would have been owed for April. I canceled this service and it was never credited and now they are keeping my internet disconnected for this amount.

I called Comcast because the tech said he did not have a number for me to call and after being transferred and disconnected they did verify that this is policy and there sorry I was miss informed but they could not leave the converter boxes, I after speaking with Comcast found the tech in my driveway smoking cigarettes and on a personal call talking about he didn't know I was ready he thought I was still on the phone. I told him I am done and you need to get busy so he told the person he had to call them back cause he was at a customers home. So since 1 tv was here and 1 computer I instructed the tech to hook those 2 up. The tech proceed to try to hook up the 2 then informs me that he had more bad news he can not find the wiring for the front 2 rooms and the lines are are not working and that I need to call a tech to run new cable lines as the home owner's association guidelines does not allow Comcast techs to do this service and that I would need to get this installation cancelled so the tech called in and ask me to cancel installation which I did. Now keep in mind I already took had took Friday off to have this done. I then took off Wed June 3 so the tech could come and run cable lines. The tech entered my premises and was able to find the cable line in less than 3 minutes and was able to tell me after his assessment and testing there was nothing wrong with the lines. I then called Comcast and informed them of the techs inaccuracy and that hiring a tech to do a job that Comcast should be able to provide does not sit well with me. A agent then informed me the earliest they could get me a New installation date would be June 16, I explained this is unacceptable for such poor service. The agent contacted his supervisor who told the agent he had to do a forced appointment for June 16 but would contact me before the close of business Thurs June 4 with an sooner appointment than June 16. I also went to Xfinity in York PA and asked to speak to a manager to file a complaint and was informed they were only the sales division and they would send a memo out to the installation dept informing them of what transpired and to see if they could get me a sooner appointment and she would contact me before close of business Thurs also. Unfortunate to say I did not hear back from either xfinity York Pa or the Supervisor so I called in to Comcast again I informed them that neither party responded back so was tranfered to installation who stated they could only do a forced appointment for June 10 between 12pm and 5pm since I had an appointment and I cancelled it, but I let them know I only cancelled because the tech instructed me too. I informed the tech that I have to be to work and can not accommodate that schedule the best I could do is to have the tech be here before 12 and be done by 2pm. Well sadly to say it's 12pm and no tech so I call in again and the tech informs me that they see the note but I am a squeeze in and when they get time they will get to me and there is nothing they can do. I have taken 1 day of work to have Comcast installed. Which
 didn't get done then I took another day off work because the Comcast tech said I needed to have 2 cable lines installed and had to hire a tech only to find out their is nothing wrong with the cable lines and now it is 1:30pm and still no tech and I won't get cable installed again cause I have to get back to work.

Which is unfair because if you have an issue they know that and don't want to help. I have complained several times about the internet being slow and cutting out which I have the medium grade service and they just act like that you have to buy the top of the line internet which is apparently according to them about $50-$70 a month which is ridiculous. To me we don't get good service and treated properly when we call in with an issue. Its always the TV's fault or Netflix fault but never their internet's fault.

 Its hard enough running a small business but having Comcast's failure to solve this has cost us dearly in lost revenue and opportunity.

 We tested your hypothesis of a broken DNSSEC by installing Google DNS servers on our Comcast router, (replacing the Comcast dns server) and our site functions perfectly. Google uses DNSSEC. Why will this work with a google dns server and not Comcast? The DNSSEC is the same for both?

270964,Billing Issues,5/4/2015,1:09:57 AM,Internet,Dublin,California,94568,Solved,Yes,"I have been overcharged every month for the past 11 months for $10 for a extra modem fee. I have
 been paying for 2 modem fee, when I only have one. I just took a look at my bill today while I was
 having issues with Comcast. I looked at my previous bills and saw I was over paying. I was set up
 under auto payment. The account is under my parents name as they cant speak and read English
 much and they dont look at the bills often. I am their daughter and today I looked at the bills online
 and opted out of Auto payment. I spoke to Comcast representative and they were rude and finally
 agreed on crediting me $50. While the payment was $10 each month for 11 months, which is $110.
 Another issue was I was paying too much and called Comcast asking for a representative when my
 deal ended and was charged $103 my internet service. That's when I contacted Comcast and got a
 discount after calling 3-4 times dealing with rude Customer Reps. I was finally given a deal for 60$
 when I was promised I would be given the same speed after I asked three -four times. I was
 reassured it would be same. That week the internet service was slow and I did a speed test it was 25
 mbps. That's when i took a look at my bill and saw they gave me the wrong plan with the wrong
 speed. I was given the internet plus 25 plan which is clearly the 25 mbps plan. I gave a call again to
 Comcast and explained their mistakes. Again i had to deal with different customer reps, they
 accepted their mistakes. Even though they accepted their mistakes, I was told i would have to pay
 $10 more for the super blast speed of 105 mbps which I was promised. After contacting several
 people at Comcast, I agreed to paying more because everything is connected to my internet. For
 example my phone plan and my tv service. I gave them a call today because the speed was still
 under 25 mbps. I went through all the steps the customer rep told me and found out it was a issue
 with my router. That's when I decided I would get a new router and a modem. Previously I was paying
 for a modem Comcast provided me. When I asked the customer rep that I would surely by given $10
 off my bill if I bought my own modem. He clearly told me no because he stated that I was using my
 own modem, when I clearly was not. When I was given a discount on my plan. The modem fee was
 taken off and it didnt appear on my bill, so i am guessing he thought I was using my own modem. I
 kept telling him 5-6 times in a nice tone. He on the other hand started yelling at me. I even told him he
 can have the Comcast people come out to my house and see the modem I am using is theirs. It
 clearly states Comcast underneath. After that he stated I could use my own and take that to the
 Comcast store and I would be given extra $10 off, so my bill would be $50 instead of $60. His name
 was Alex V. His customer rep id was alex v.
 id GNOPEN RACKET and was speaking from the PHILLIPEANS. That is when I took a look at my
 previous bills and saw I was actually paying for 2 modems. The name is Docsis 3 Leased Modem and
 formerly D3 voice equipment ( which I was told is a just a modem). When I called about this issue.
 Comcast people werent available as I called after hours, So i spoke to someone on the Chat server
 which I found on the Comcast Website. I explained to him I had been overpaying since May 2014,
 that's when I checked my bills and saw I was overcharged. He was ready to pay back the $50 credit
 which i talked about in the beginning of this complaint. I am fed up with the customer service support"

266686,Comcast Refuses to Fix Billing If a Virus Causes Data Usage Over Cap on a system protected by THEIR AV,4/30/2015,2:50:13 PM,Internet,Duluth,Georgia,30097,Closed,No,"Hi,
 So a family member's computer was using the Comcast provided Norton Antivirus suite (link to suite: http://constantguard.comcast.net/products-and-services/norton-security-suite//) to protect their computer. They were infected with a trojan which installed a piracy server and was running heavy bittorrent traffic. We discovered this because we got multiple DMCA complaints AND a huge usage bill during a month when we were out of the country for ten days.
 I confronted Comcast with this when they last called me about a complaint I made, and they agreed that it looked like the uptick in usage from this January forward was probably caused by the virus.
 Nevertheless, they said we had used up our ""three complimentary billing modifications"" and would therefore receive no modification. We were also told that Norton does not protect against trojans and therefore it was not Comcast's or Norton's fault, which is weird because Norton says they do (link to Norton here: http://us.norton.com/security_response/malware.jsp) and so does Comcast:
 Here's more proof from their site: ( http://constantguard.comcast.net/about/ ):
 ""Constant Guard provides access to top-rated security products and services.
 Products like Nortonâ„¢ Security Suite (for PC) and Nortonâ„¢ Internet Security (for Mac) offer superior protection against viruses and other online threats, including spyware, trojans, worms, and bots, and are provided free-of-charge for XFINITY Internet customers. ""
 How on earth is it reasonable that despite using the security solution provided by Comcast which says (at least on their site, despite their employees being happy to say otherwise on the phone if it helps them avoid being responsible for something) that it protects against the very thing we were attacked by, we are being billed for a failure by that product?!
 The only reason we haven't switched to another provider that does not cap data usage is that we have no alternative broadband provider in our area. Their employees have shouted at us (even when we're being polite), accused us of piracy, have tried to shame us into giving up on complaints and are generally mean and unpleasant. If a grocery store or car company or any other company treated us this way, we'd tell them thanks but no thanks and go elsewhere. Not possible here. If we weren't so powerless, I wouldn't keep making these complaints.
 Thanks,

 disappointed first time customer. I first called to establish service on May 19, 2015 and unfortunately
 still do not have anything setup. I have recently downgraded and canceled several times due to poor
 customer service and broken promises from managers that technicians would come to setup my
 service. I have missed work on 5/24 and 5/26 waiting on a technician to come to appointments setup
 by Comcast and they have not shown up on two occasions. A technician came on 5/30 and told me
 that he did not have time to setup an outlet and wasn't aware that is what was needed. I contacted
 Comcast while the technician was still at my home and the manager heard the technician tell me that
 he did not have time and could not setup the outlet because he had other appointments. The
 manager was appalled and said this is not the way Comcast does business and he apologized to
 me. He again talked me into keeping the service and promised that he would have someone to come
 out by end of business day or Sunday. It is 5pm today on 5/31 and a technician has not come to
 setup my service. I've called three times and was reassured that a technician would come out today.
 My urgency to get internet is school work that I've had to go other places to get done due to no
 internet service in my home. I put $150 deposit on to establish service and when I wanted to cancel, I
 was told that I could go to the service center to be refunded. I went to the service center to be
 refunded on 5/27 and waited 45 mins in line, I was told that Comcast does not give cash refunds and
 I should receive my reimbursement via mail in 6 to 8 weeks. I was talked into keeping my service
 while there and was guaranteed that a technician would come out to set everything up. This has been
 a nightmare for me and I just want to get internet service and treated like a valuable customer."

They recently began limiting our data usage to 300GB a month and charging $10 for each 50GB used after that. I pay for a 50Mbps\10Mbps connection. Even if I were to look at 50% of that speed, 25Mbps\5Mbps, with a 300GB cap, and data was constantly being used during a 30day period, it equates to about 8TB. At 45Mbps, I could download 300GB in about 16hrs. For a family of four in this age of streaming video, cloud services, video conferencing, and online gaming, this data cap is ridiculous.
 Furthermore, upon nearing this cap, Comcast beings displaying a pop up in browser to warn me of my usage. This is invasive, and obtrusive. But worse, it is dangerous. This is Comcast injecting code into my request code, aka hijacking my requested data and inserting their own code. The code leaves me open to vulnerabilities and is poorly written. So poorly written that it often breaks the page request it is injected into. Here is a picture of the pop up and a cop of the injected code.

285591,Comcast-flat fee contract-misrepresentation,5/12/2015,1:11:10 PM,Internet,East Brunswick,New Jersey,8816,Solved,No,"My issue with Comcast stems from the fact that when I signed up for the internet service I was
 promised a flat fee, 24 month contract, and now Comcast has raised fees on equipment and refuses
 to provide a refund. My office contacted the company about 4-5times, speaking and being
 transferred to at least 10 representatives during these calls.
 The initial inquiry regarding the increase fee for equipment from $9.95 to $12.95 was on April 8, 2015.
 On April 27, 2015 after further review of billing statement, my office contacted Comcast for the
 second time. During this time, we spoke to Comcast customer representative, Priscilla Woodbury.
 Each time we spoke, the Comcast representative first pointed to the statement of work and then to
 the contract terms. However, the contract terms do not give Comcast permission to raise equipment
 fee on a flat-fee contract.
 It should also be noted that when selling me the 24 month contract the representative did not mention
 that Comcast may raise equipment fee during the life of the contract.
 At one point, one of the Comcast representatives gave us a telephone number for ""legal."" Upon
 calling the number, we were told that it was only for criminal acts on the internet and send us back,
 yet again, to the general Comcast number for billing inquiries.
 My office contacted Comcast for the third time, on April 30, 2015 and spoke to Theo, a Comcast
 representative. Theo advised us that the increase in the equipment fee was a mistake and will be
 adjusted to the promised flat fee rate. He also credited the account with a $20 (twenty dollar) credit.
 On May 11, 2015, my office received a Comcast billing statement. The billing statement
 contained a .60 cent refund only. Missing from the billing statement was the $20 refund promised by
 Theo.
 On May 12, 2015, my office contacted Comcast yet again. I urged to discuss with a supervisor about
 the poor and inconsistent customer service. Supervisor Danielle Macklin advised me that equipment
 fee is going to go up again to $12.95 (what Theo did was a onetime adjustment). Danielle advised me
 that Comcast has 100% power of raising any equipment fees and it is unclear whether I will be
 receiving the refund.
 Again, neither the service order nor the contract specify that despite selling me a flat fee contract,
 Comcast retains the right to charge increased equipment fees. This is consumer fraud when a
 Comcast representative, selling me a contract, tells me that I am buying into a flat-fee agreement that
 will not go up during the life of the contract but thereafter, I am told that Comcast can raise equipment
 fees and that this grant of power is in the contract yet the Contract does not specify this right."
344657,Comcast Internet problems,6/16/2015,10:34:58 PM,Internet,East Brunswick,New Jersey,8816,Solved,No,"For a few months now I have a problem with the Internet access. It is important to note that I have two devices connected to the same cable. One of them is the cable/phone adapter that sits very close to the cable entry into the house and the cable modem that is located on the second floor. Both devices exhibit intermittent connection, and the pattern of no-connectivity is exactly the same on both devices.
 After numerous calls to Comcast and every time going through the process of plug-unplug-wait-try-again I succeeded to get the technician to agree to establish some monitoring procedure on my account to determine the cause of intermittent failures. The same technician had replaced the underground cable run with the bright orange cable running across my front yard to the cable box near the end of the property. That happened over two months ago. I was promised that the temporary cable will be replaced with an underground one when the troubleshooting is over.
 Needless to say the problem has not been solved.
 I made several attempts to contact Comcast and every time I spend over an hour on the phone being transferred several times needlessly spending the time on the same plug-unplug-wait-try-again procedure. There seems to be no record of what was done a couple of months ago. I am giving up. It feels that the customer service is designed to run us around without really addressing the problem.
 I am looking for help. I am a paying customer and have been for many years, this is not the way a company should treat customers.

 example, instead of investigating why their rented router and modem equipment is not working
 properly, they require that I first purchase higher speed (blast) internet connectivity. When that fails
 to solve the technology issue, they then have refused or delayed removing the additional service from
 my account. Comcast also insists on scheduling a $75 service technician visit to ensure that my
 phone service is working, even though I do not use their phone service. I am subscribed to. 'Triple

 Comcast only for Internet and cable. Despite this the company insists on charging a $75 phone

 calls to Comcast billing, customer service, and advanced technical support. Their Security Assurance

 Dear FCC Representative,
 I am writing to request a meeting with an FCC investigator regarding the complaint referenced below.
 I have been contacted by a Comcast head office official, however I find that the remedy offered to me
 is wholly unsatisfactory as of June 20th. For several months I was left without working internet
 service, and in response Comcast offered no more than a $12 refund of an extraneous fee. I had
 requested a replacement router / modem (which was proven to be the correct solution to my service
 problem) and was denied the ability to receive such a replacement. During this time I paid
 approximately $540 in service fees and encountered nearly 50 percent downtime.
 Furthermore, I believe that Comcast's practice of attempting to forced customers to purchase high
 speed 'blast' internet service was inappropriate for someone who complained about chronic outages
 but never once indicated that slow speed was at issue. I am therefore asking the FCC to conduct a
 class action investigation to better understand whether this is a systemic problem in Comcast's Call
 (b) (6)
 Center procedures and training that affects the entire class of customers who presently use their
 basic 'high speed' internet service package.
 I can be reached at to provide additional details and clarification. Suffice it to say that
 Comcast has d one its utmost to minimize this complaint by not even acknowledging the nearly 3
 months of failure in resolving the problem. Instead they have chosen to count only the time from
 which their head office became involved during the past few weeks.
 I appreciate your help in this matter and reiterate that Comcast has not resolved this issue, despite
 what I expect them to report to the FCC to try to sweep this under the rug and avoid further regulatory
 scrutiny.

 was an ""open ticket"" Called Comcast at least 5 times, ""open ticket, two accounts, no one could figure
 out how to help get service working. Finally ordered a Tech to come out. Tech was great but had no
 information, knew nothing about the problems I was having, took over 4 hours to get every thing

 figure it out. Called Comcast on 5/18 to make sure billing was correct, talked to Kevin, caller ID -
 KC3550, very sympathetic and understanding about my frustrations, said he made some adjustments
 to my bill because of the trouble I had. Phone service stopped working on 5/18, called Comcast, told
 we have an old modem, (not sure why it wasn't changed during install). On the phone again for over
 45 minutes. Asked about the credit to my bill that Kevin made, no record that Kevin did anything! He
 flat out lied to me to get me off the phone! 2nd time that has happened, I asked to speak to a
 supervisor on one of the many calls and the person just hung up on me! I am disgusted and feed up
 with the treatment Comcast has given me. I have been a customer for years and they obviously DO
 NOT CARE! We will see how it goes today with another Tech coming out to get phone service going

 Outlook for Mac 2011 at home. It SIMPLY doesn't work. And Comcast won't do anything about it.
 They say it's a problem with the Microsoft product. I have called Microsoft and the technicians went
 through the settings and there's nothing wrong. They suspect that the server settings are incorrect,
 but Comcast won't do anything about it. Microsoft says I have to use Office 365 and pay them to
 access my email using Outlook. Otherwise there's nothing else they can do. Comcast keeps telling
 me the problem is with my Outlook and Microsoft must fix it.
 Comcast plays the blame game...blaming everybody else for its crappy service. Meanwhile to get the

My attempts to address this issue with Comcast customer service have been met with the intent to willfully neglect the nature of our circumstance as well as the irony that they gouge low income seniors on the $10 TV service with $70 monthly internet service I have no choice but to pay with the biannual price increases. With my husband's disability and the need to expend significant amounts of time and financial resources in working with his doctors located about fifty miles away, we truly need title 2 enforced given the necessity to have broadband to make medical arrangements possible.

275612,Misrepresentation of billing,5/6/2015,11:18:43 AM,Internet,El Cerrito,California,94530,Solved,No,"When signing up for a bundled service in December 2014, we bought Comcast Internet, cable, and
 home protection. We were supposed to get showtime for 5.00, a dr, and a visa check card for 300.
 After 90 days. We have not received any of those. Trying to resolve this over numerous calls has
 proven unsuccessful. Each time I call, the tech seems confused about our account, they say the card
 is in the mail, they want to charge me for a dvr and showtime costs 15.00 not 5 as promised. My
 account is in good standing and I want what was promised me. I feel that they've lied to me ."
281211,"Constant non response, or passing to other operator. Supervisers inability to resolve of help. Numerous lies told.",5/8/2015,7:02:27 PM,Internet,El Cerrito,California,94530,Closed,No,"After 6 months of free HBO for a smaller problem, my bill went up as they started charging me for the
 HBO. But it had gone up more than price of HBO. So I asked what options were available. Was told if
 I bundled phone into my internet and cable I'd get better price. I had been paying $147 or so month.
 Was quoted the new price would be around $100. I was talking $147 as complete price,. It turns out
 the $100 price they were quoting was for just the bundle, not other fees and taxes. I specifically asked
 about entire bill, not just the bundle. I've explained to them that they at least misled me, or lied. That
 they were talking apples to my oranges. No response to this. When I had agreed to this""Bundle"" I was
 told my first bill would be higher than $100 as the month would reflect two different purchase plans.
 But that my second bill would then be lower. To get this ""Bundle"" I had to agree to a two year
 contract, even though I've been a Comcast customer for many years. About 15-20, with a small 1
 year break when I had no internet or cable. Never had to sign another contract beside my first one
 back years ago. So I get my first bill. It's $111. As explained. I pay it and don't complain. Second bill
 comes, and it's $125, not only higher than the $100 bill I was promised, but also higher than the $111
 bill from previous month. So I start complaining to the 800#. What a run around. During one
 conversation, I'm looking at the bill, and I see my ""Bundle"" costs $99. So, I suggest to the super, that
 their salesman misled me when I was always referring to the $147 I was talking total price, not the
 bundle price, yet he only talked partial bill. This super admitted that this was probably what happened,
 but he couldn't do anything about it, as I'd bought my contract at a payment center when I paid my
 bill. So I must go back to that payment center to resolve this. He said he would email or call the
 supervisor at that payment center, to advise him of our discussion, and then he gave me a telephone
 number he said was a direct line to that supervisor, so I could make an appointment to see him. Next
 day I call this number, and it is not a direct line to him, but just another 800# reverting my call the the
 HELL Concast calls service. At this point I'm explaining my problem to yet another ignorant, useless
 operator or supervisor. Concast, and they are con artists, never keeps a record of your complaint, so
 with every new operator, I must start at the beginning, and repeat entire complaint. So this person
 explains, that there is no way to call a supervisor, they do not give out that info. So I must go in
 person, to speak to him. Which I tried. I went to the payment center, ask for super, and am told he
 isn't there, and rarely is. I can only have him call me, not make appointment to see him. Now this
 means it's at his convenience, not mine. I explain, I want to cancel my contract. Am told they can't do
 that . I must talk to super. At this point I'm given a ""We're On It"" card. It has another 800# to call for a
 no wait hot line. Again I call, again have to tell this entire saga. I explain how I was lied to for price, I
 was lied to by a super about getting a hold of super at payment center, given another 800# that didn't
 get me to that person, and that generally Concast was totally not admitting to any guilt. Every
 operator saying they had no record of these conversations, so they don't know them to be the truth.
 So I explain that they have a 30 day period to cancel a contract. Because that first bill was for $111,
 as expected, I didn't complain in those 30 days. But when I got my $125 bill I did. I had no reason to
 complain until then. So the 30 days should be extended. This super said no, they wouldn't do that.
 That the only way out was to pay a $280 termination fee. I'm furious. They lied to me numerous times,
 and won't take any blame. But I want out of these folks so bad, I agree to this $280 fee. The super
 then says I have to pass you to another operator to cancel. And this is what Concast is great at. They
 pass you to operator, to super, to operator, to super, to try and wear you out. You always have to
 retell your complaint. So, now I'm talking to the operator who will cancel my contract. I tell him I want
 my service to end a week from today. May 14th. I ask how soon do I need to return modem and cable
 TV remote, etc. He tells me a week. But there is a problem with the modem. By their records it is
 mine, not theirs. According to them I already returned it. CRAZY. Ya can't make this up. So I assure
 him the modem is theirs. We agree to turn everything off May 14th. I hang up, and run errands. I
 come home, and no internet. Cable works, but no internet. I check every connection and retry. I retry
 numerous times over the next two hours. No luck. So I call Concast. There operator again says it isn't
 their modem. It must be mine. But he tries from his computer to reset my modem any way. Tries
 numerous times. Finally he goes into my account. Asks me if I canceled my service today. I said yes.
 He fiddles around some more. Then he tells me they have turned off my internet as of then, not May
 14th. And here's the kicker. Drum roll, he tells me the only way I can get my internet turned back on,
 is to cancel the termination notice. I'm furious, and scream and swear at him. He says that he can't do
 this, I must talk to another operator. The old wear down trick. Needing my internet, I give in. I go to
 the next operator. He asks me to cancel my termination, I do, in internet comes on my computer.
 Then get this, HE can't remake my termination. Again I must go to another operator. He tells me I'll
 transfer you to this person. I'm on hold, and then get a recording that this service is closed, please
 call back tomorrow. Just pass you around until you give up. I have time to do this. Not every one
 does. This has been over two weeks of HELL. There are three other episodes like this in the past
 about vacation shut off. I forgave them for those. Not this time. Plus I fear if they turned my internet
 off once, I can't ask to terminate until it is actually the 14th of May, as they might turn it off again. Plus
 I'm worried they might double charge me the $280 termination fee. As I'm going to have to ask to be
 terminated again. With their logic, they will say I agreed to turn it back on so I should be double billed."
363708,Comcast chronic lies,6/24/2015,11:51:56 PM,Internet,El Cerrito,California,94530,Open,No,"On 6/4/15 I called Comcast because of a recent Comcast cable DSL internet service outage and said I should not have to pay for service when there is none. Comcast cust. serv. rep. agreed to reduce monthly service bill by $5. I also informed her that I keep getting delays and echoes when using VOIP with Comcast. She reset my connection and said she would start a customer loyalty discount of $5 per month for the 12 months. None of the refund or discounts has happened with my new bill and when I called Comcast cust. serv. today they say they have no record of what I was told on 6/4. When I asked for a Comcast cust. serv. email address so that I could conduct business with them in a clearly document-able way, I was told there is none! VOIP is also still a problem. This is not the first time Comcast has flat out lied -- I had similar problems when starting service with them and was told a specific internet up/download speed for a specific price and then was given a significantly slower speed for that quoted price.

 Sirs;
 Regarding the closure of my complaint, Ticket No. 363708:
 The overall purpose -- and resolution -- of my complaint is to get an accurate, reliable, recordable method of communicating and having questions answered by Comcast. That has not happened yet. Specifically, a Comcast rep., Michael M., responded to my complaint by email and gave me information that does not agree with information I obtained by contacting Comcast through their online customer chat (chat gives a text record). I emailed Michael M. on July 20 to clarify this but have gotten nothing back.

I never hooked up the TV receiver and just returned the equipment. Now Comcast says I'm no longer eligible for the original plan (supposed to be valid 12 months) and must pay $66.95 for the same Internet only plan. I asked to be reinstated to the same original plan I signed up for in April and they claim it's ""not available"" because now I'm an existing customer and not a ""New customer"" The reps and their so called retention department conveniently forgot to mention this when trying to sign me up for Double Play and then cancelling the Double Play. This is a very sleazy way to get me off the original relatively low cost Internet only plan...please see the attached ""One Time Charges"" where they are billing me for Double Play that I never used, and at the higher monthly rate for the Internet Only service.

My bill increased by $3/month the later part of 2014. In February 2015 they bumped it up to $140.
 I have tried several times over the past few months to get Comcast to honor the contract terms but have failed. Today a Comcast retention specialist flat out stated that they would not honor the $99.80/month 3-year contract. To further add insult to injury, I inquired about terminating my relationship with Comcast for breach of contract. They stated they would hold me to the same contract's termination fees that they will not honor for the monthly cost. I have no other option for broadband at this location so I cannot take my business elsewhere. I must have broadband.
 I have attached the February 2015 bill and 3-year contract. I am being improperly charged. I need help because I do not have the resources to battle a multi-billion dollar corporation and the phone service representatives know it.

312797,Comcast/Xfinity Data Allowance,5/28/2015,11:52:24 PM,Internet,Elizabethtown,Kentucky,42701,Pending,No,"Recently I subscribed to Comcast's internet service in my new area. After I had already signed up for
 the service I started researching further and it turns out our data has very low monthly limits.
 Comcast is currently undergoing ""trials"" in certain markets where it is charging customers $10 for
 every 50GB used over 300GB per month. I think this is ridiculous in this day and age. Before my
 move we were serviced by Mediacom which also uses data thresholds but they do it on a much more
 reasonable level. For instance, a customer on Mediacom's 3mbps plan gets allocated 150GB per
 month, 50mbps customers are allocated 350GB per month and 105 mbps customers are allocated
 999GB per month and so on. With Comcast, it doesn't matter what speed you subscribe to, you only
 get 300GB per month.
 I went back and reviewed our last 3 months of data usage with Mediacom and we used 324GB,
 429GB and 294GB, giving our household an average of 349.13GB/month of used data. I can
 understand companies wanting to leverage how much data a customer should use but 300GB is not
 enough. We do not any type of unauthorized downloading of content. We simply stream Netflix, use
 Xbox Live, send and receive emails, and make some VOIP phone calls.
 It's not fair or right in any way for Comcast to use a one size fits all method. Customers should at
 least receive more monthly data allocation for higher speed subscriptions. I believe that Comcast is
 simply using this method as a way to get more money out of their customers.
 Please step in and tell Comcast that it's not right to nickel and dime us at every turn."

 Essentially they have two options..
 One is for around 6mpbs at 12 bucks or so.. I can't give you an exact figure because the weasels at Comcast won't let me look at the choices because I am behind in my bill.... In any case, the 6 mpbs is the minimum speed needed to watch (say) Netflix.
 The next choice for a faster speed is 50 mpbs... 50 is what gamers like. But it is NOT what a normal person needs for the net...
 It runs around $46 a month...
 There is NO middle ground... so most (like me) accept the higher priced one because the other is too slow...

 Re: Comcastâ€™s Collection efforts for the account of
 Dear Mr. ,
 is deceased, but that is not the problem.
 The problem is Comcastâ€™s asinine - or perhaps wisely deceptive - manner of giving â€œcustomer supportâ€. Comcastâ€™s support is asinine if it is just the result of disorganization, but almost criminal if it is set up so the customer cannot easily cancel and receive verification of the cancellation.
 In my opinion, the latter seems to be the case. First I went online both by email and chat to try to cancel; I was told I had to call to cancel by phone. I called at least three times and was given a 20 to 30 minute wait time with no option for a call back. I was not going to wait, and since I was leaving on a trip I sent a letter. I did receive a call from a woman named , and she said the account was closed, but she could/would not give me a verification email or cancellation code. WHY NOT!!
 What an unpleasant surprise to arrive home to â€œpast dueâ€ bills and â€œfriendlyâ€ calls from your company. If only such â€œon-the-ballâ€ efficiency would have been in effect when I tried to cancel.
 â€™ account has been paid promptly for the past 30 years until it was CANCELLED in the beginning of April 2015. It was cancelled by me! I live alone and have been overseas since January 9 until April 10, 2015.
 Probably, I would have resumed service on my return, but now I have FIOS; you have lost/alienated a customer and created one more person who will tell others of the poor performance of your business. You can advertise â€œserviceâ€ all you want, but the actions of your company say the opposite.
 Lastly, with the receipt of this letter I want the false billing and phone calls to stop. (b) (6)

 P.S. Take a look at your website; even logged in the customer has no way to communicate with anyone other than phone reps. If the customer is logged, why canâ€™t they cancel on line and get verification?

361453,Comcast Failed to Switch our Systems to New Location and Shut Down the Current Location,6/24/2015,11:36:18 AM,Internet,Ellicott City,Maryland,21043,Solved,No,"We've been dealing with Comcast for over a month. We were using them previously at our office location, but have been in the process of moving a few blocks away into our warehouse area. They told us the install would be no problem and that our account wouldn't be shut down until it was installed and then we'd have 30 days to transition over there. After 2 weeks of calling our representative, we have not received any returned message or answers. Now, Comcast shut down the service at our office location, which means we don't have phone or internet service and are hurting because no one can contact us easily.
 After 4 hours on the phone with them today, and after weeks of calling to get things switched over, we've had enough. They set a date for the install, but never showed up.

256173,Comcast slamming issue,4/24/2015,6:11:23 PM,Internet,Elmhurst,Illinois,60126,Closed,No,"Comcast has engaged in ""slamming"" by charging a different rate to my account than what was explained to me on the phone. This occurred on a retentions call with Arnisha on 2/13/2015, which I recorded in its entirety and can be reviewed here: http://gadgetscope.com/comcastfcccomplaint/
 Here is a summary of the call by timecode:
 7:20: ""$20 loyalty credit,"" which will ""take you down to $89.99.""
 7:41: I confirm that the service will remain as Digital Preferred.
 7:50: ""$89.99 a month for 6 months"" reconfirmed.
 8:20: ""For 6 months, $89.99"" confirmed again.
 8:50: ""$89.99,"" ""6 months"" and ""no contract"" confirmed again.
 At no time: Was a rate $109.99 ever discussed or mentioned.
 Subsequent to this I spoke with Mario at Comcast's executive care unit multiple times regarding errors in the discounts Arnisha had actually entered to my account. With my first contact on March 9, he promised to correct the problem, and he at that time confirmed that my discounted rate would be affected by setting my package discount rate to $109.99 and issuing two $60.00 credits, resulting in a $20/month price drop for 6 months. I agreed to this.
 In my next bill, my package rate showed as $129.99. Upon contacting Mario again, he insisted that this was correct and my bundle rate was $109.99. I offered to play the recording of my call with Arnisha, but Mario refused to listen to my recording and scheduled an internal review of Comcast's recording.
 On April 10, Mario called me and advised me that ""You were offered a credit in a lump sum to satisfy a $109.99 rate for 6 months,"" which obviously contradicts the recording I supplied above and is a lie. Mario stubbornly stuck to Comcast's lie, and here I am filing an FCC complaint.
 I request as restitution that my bundle rate be retroactively set to $109.99 from 2/13/2015 through the 6 months that Arnisha promised me (thus, combined with the lump sum credits I already have received, bringing me to $89.99), and I request a further 6 months of that bundle rate as compensation for the time spent pursuing my escalation with Comcast executive care, and this FCC complaint following lies told to me by Mario in that department.
 Comcast is the ONLY provider of wired broadband internet (per FCC's current definition) in my area, and is abusing its monopoly power by not only charging excessive prices, but slamming customers and making false statements about promised rates in recorded calls. I also ask for the FCC to pursue regulatory action to correct this pattern of abusive behavior.

290961,Please stop Broadband bandwidth caps,5/14/2015,7:47:10 PM,Internet,Emeryville,California,94662,Closed,No,"Hello,
 I'd like to voice my support for any legislation enacted by the FCC that would ban broadband internet
 bandwidth caps. These caps are clearly just a scam by the Comcast, Cox and other residential ISP's
 to increase their bottom line with more and more people cutting cable television but keeping internet.
 Bandwidth costs have been coming down in the last few years, unlike what the ISP's want you to
 believe that these costs have increased.
 I have almost 20 years of IT industry experience and I tell you that bandwidth costs in the last few
 years has been decreasing at an even faster rate than ever before. Just a few years ago you would
 have to pay $10000+/mo for a gigabit fiber connection, now one can be had for $4-5k/month.
 This is clearly a way for ISP's to claim that their bandwidth is ""limited"" but in reality there's plenty of it.
 What is limited, is their neighborhood network ""nodes"" that are oversubscribed and they refuse to split
 them to alleviate congestion in order so that they can claim their network is ""congested"" to justify the
 bandwidth caps.
 These caps need to be stopped before they are rolled out nationwide like I'm sure Comcast and
 others want to do ASAP.
 With cloud services becoming the norm more and more lately bandwidth should be unlimited for
 consumers to benefit from these services.
 Thanks for your time."

359991,Pricing Concerns,6/23/2015,7:59:41 PM,Internet,Encino,California,95051,Open,No,"The only available residential broadband ISP in my area is Comcast. While we'd love more competition out here, nobody seems to be entering the market. As such Comcast seems to do as it pleases pricing wise, forcing us into bundles for services we do not want or need. For example, dropping cable actually increases my costs, where as adding phone service drops it for 6 months to a year; although pricing will just go up again once that period ends.
 If there were competition they might be forced into offering better / more reliable service at more reasonable pricing to keep customers. Unfortunately AT&T's Uverse is not built out in our area so Comcast has nothing to feer.
 I'm concerned that this will only get worse once the TimeWarner merger is complete. Please work with Comcast to address their monopolistic pricing. , Alternatively, please work with AT&T to push them to delivery on the commitments from their last several acquisitions to increase broadband penetration, potentially making it a condition of their upcoming DirecTV acquisition.

370823,"95 Palmer Road, Enfield NH Internet Pricing",6/28/2015,11:36:24 AM,Internet,Enfield,New Hampshire,3748,Open,Yes,"My only available broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television from my service package. I was ""forced"" into taking a package initially when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this package was 35 dollars a month. Internet service on its own without cable was 65 dollars a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and have just never watched cable television. For the past 3 years my bill has been slowly creeping upwards until it has now reached over 80 dollars a month for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

 Additionally, I've had 2 service techs to my house to improve my wireless connection. Neither tech has resolved the issue, forcing me to buy my own wireless router to adequately supply wireless internet to my entire (very small) house.
 In addition to the above, my ""promotional package"" is expiring, which will increase my bill from $135/mo up to $200/mo. Comcast's new ""promotion"" is to keep my price the same, but force me to add a landline (who uses a landline?!) for an additional $35/mo, which (according to them) is going to save me $30/mo. Oh, and if I want to ""take advantage"" of this ""great deal"" I have to pay them a one-time fee of $50.
 If it's not painfully apparent, Comcast is a terrible company and they've been bending over and ass-raping their customers for so long that the execs should be charged, fined and locked away in small, shit-filled animal cages.

249470,Bundled Service,4/22/2015,8:57:24 AM,Internet,Englewood,Florida,34224,Closed,No,"Hello,
 I've been reading a lot online as to where to go to file a complaint about my Comcast service, and filing a complaint with the FCC has been the most popular answer.
 I am hoping someone is able to help me. I ALWAYS have a problem with Comcast.. from someone telling me they will call back and never do, to setting up a move and the whole thing turned out to be completely wrong.
 First I will start out with this past week I set up a move transfer from one house to another. After the woman I talked to said ""this call may be recorded for quality purposes"" (a call I wish could be replayed so the rep knows what a mistake she made), we went on to put in to motion the transfer of service. I said disconnect our service on April 27th (the call was on the 16th) and start service at our new house on the 30th. She verified these dates a few more times, and even said something along the lines ""are you sure the 27th? I wouldn't want you to be in the middle of a show and your tv go out"".. after the call I felt relieved everything was transferred.
 A few hours later, our internet went out. Then I got an email that said service/billing at your new home starts on 04/16/15 - which began to make me mad. The rep was very quick and friendly and I felt in good hands. (Copy of that email has been attached to this email).
 I then called Comcast and the next rep I got assured me the problem would be taken care of and took my current address Englewood FL 34224) and said he would reconnect service. A few minutes later and being on hold - this was close to 11pm, our cable goes out. He comes back and says I will have to transfer you to tech support so they can help you reconnect your service. Then told me he comes back in the following day at 2:30pm and will call me ""as soon as he walks in the door"" to begin the move transfer all over again. That call he promised never came.
 I then got another email (dated April 17 at 5am) verifying new service to be turned on at the address of Englewood FL (again our current address is Englewood FL 34224) - this email has been attached as well.
 So after getting THAT email I called again, getting more and more angry because moving or just dealing in general with ANY rep from Comcast is a nightmare I do not wish to go through. I spoke with the same rep I originally spoke with who assured me my move transfer was successful and there would be no problem, the same rep I assume is responsible for putting in the wrong dates and causes all of these problems. She said she worked in a third party website and had limitef access to my (b) (6)
 (b) (6) (b) (6)
 account so she couldn't turn my service back on for some reason, then transferred me to someone else.
 The next rep, who I was on the phone with for OVER TWO HOURS, spent a long time canceling the service at our new house (the NEW adress is Port Charlotte FL 33981), because it was turned on the 16th and wasn't suppose to be on until the 30th. She then had to cancel the request to start service on , because that isn't our address nor has it ever been our address. She then had to set up an entirely NEW account at our current house () just so we could get our service back on. After two hours of this, she finally came back to say all of our services should be working and we will need to call back in a few days after the system updates to start the move transfer again - but mid sentence the phone disconnects. I know she had my number, so I waited about 15 minutes for a call back which I never received. Went home after work to find internet and cable back on, so I assumed everything was fine.
 That night, I got ANOTHER email verifying that our service is scheduled to be turned on at (email dated April 17th at 5:03pm - also attached to this email).
 I am BEYOND angry. Every single time I deal with Comcast there is a problem. This time I will not sit around and talk to them for hours and hope the problem can be fixed. I am being proactive and emailing anyone and everyone in hopes that this will finally be a wake up call to Comcast to actually RESOLVE my problems once and for all.
 I am hoping by emailing you, you can help in someway. Thank you so much for your time and l look forward to hearing back from you,
 Current address until April 27th - Englewood FL 34224
 Address after April 27th - Port Charlotte FL 33981

291730,Comcast fradulent Marketing and billing for internet,5/15/2015,12:48:33 PM,Internet,Eugene,Oregon,97402,Solved,No,"The Problem: I called into Comcast to inquire about a rate increase, from $34.99/mo to $78.mo, and
 to see if I could alter my plan to something more affordable. Sales person on the line told me that the
 the only more affordable plan at the moment was to bundle a tv/ cable plan with internet, and reduce
 that $78 bill to a monthly plan of $59, that would be locked in, and the cable box (which I don't use,
 nor want) would be free.
 Anyway, in the last 2 weeks I've been attempting to pay my bill, and the new rate hasn't been
 reflected in the statement. Upon numerous phone call, I found that the original Sales person Lied
 about the locked in rate, apparently it was only good for 12 mos., they keep trying to charge me for a
 modem fee, (I own my own, and after repeated calls thet cannot seem to fix my bill to accurately
 reflect what is owed. They also threaten to discontinue service, If I don't pay the inaccurate amount
 by the due date. Its been about 2 weeks of phone call and and IM chats with their service dept. (I
 have screen shots of the chat sessions)
 So in short, the complaint is about fradulent marketing (telling me about locked in rates, promising
 speeds that I never get at this address, and adding and items and posting incorrect amount to my bill.
 Hopefully something can be done about this. While I am a fairly conscientious consumer, I assume
 that this problem are too much for peopele to deal with, and I'm afraid others with less patience or
 abilities just let themselves be over billed and over pormised by ComCast.

 Comcast has a redundant loop complaint phone system that is equally unreliable requiring 10
 minutes or more to initiate a stand in line for service. Their staff are unable to resolve technical
 problems that are entirely Comcast's. All of this yet they still demand a monthly fee for terrible
 products that don't work as advertised. If I performed as Comcast does I would subject to arrest in

I'm pretty angry right now and feel that Comcast needs to keep with the pricing they originally gave me. Why raise the price? The speed is the same, as is my service, I haven't added anything to my service. So in that sense what is their reasoning for raising my prices? Did the internet data price go up? I don't know why it would.

363716,Frequent disconnects,6/24/2015,11:59:03 PM,Internet,Eugene,Oregon,97401,Solved,No,"My service, while normally of appropriate (slower than I'd like but not terrible) speed, has been frequently disconnecting when using higher amounts of bandwidth. Anytime my household is doing something high usage (playing an online video game, downloading a video game, playing Netflix) our internet will randomly drop connection. According to our modem we are still perfectly connected and yet nothing works. This will continue happening every 5-20 minutes until we stop using the higher bandwidth. Despite several calls to Comcast over the years and three different modems (both and without the router built in) the problem persists. Add to this that our internet bill has creeped up from $30 to $68 over the course of 2.5 years at most (and has been as high as 75 during that time) for the exact same service and I would have to say I am quite displeased.

364369,BILLING ISSUE,6/25/2015,11:48:15 AM,Internet,Eustis,Florida,32726,Solved,No,"I had comcast when I lived at Umatilla, FL. Right before i moved out i lost my job and my cable/internet was disconncted. A few months later i moved and wanted to get cable and internet again so i called comcast and had to pay a past due bill and had my services turned on at my current addres Eustis, fl 32726. I had service for around 9 months before it got disconnected for non payment. I recently have been able to get caught up on my bills, on my credit report that i ran 2 weeks ago it showed i owed comcast a bill of $191 and change which i agree with, i owed the money no doubt about it. So i called comcast and paid my balance due from Then a few days later i decided i will get just the interet connected with them so i place an online order for it. 2 days later i get a call from a comcast rep stating i owe a balance. I advised him that i do not owe anything that i payed off my balance. He states my act got audited and they realized i owed money from an act at Umatilla, FL. This is absolutely crazy, when i moved to Eustis i had paid that balance in full, i even had service turned on. Also my credit report even indicated that i only owed $191 and change and now comcast is stating that i owe them more money. There is something not right with this. Please help me. I did request for them to send me a new copy of this bill since i have never seen it. Also i have talked with several reps and none of them are able to send me a copy of the bill that i owe $97.19 on.

360826,Comcast Unfair Billing Practices,6/24/2015,4:17:46 AM,Internet,Evans,Colorado,80620,Solved,Yes,"As I was looking at my nearly 80 dollar a month bill for my wife and I's Xfinity Comcast internet services, I found a ridiculous comparison between my internet speed cost (""Performance"" package at 25mbps) and the highest offered (""Blast!"" at 150mbps). While it's true that the Blast! comes at a (slightly) higher out of contract cost than the Performance, it looks as though they're punishing me for purchasing less internet usage and services. It seems ridiculously unfair and crooked that I should have such an outrageous bill and being charged such a premium for buying a lesser package. Allow me to get to the nitty gritty.
 At my current subscription, again ""Performance"" with 25mbps at 66.95 (it's even more expensive than the 61.95 their website offers), I pay nearly $2.50 per mbps ( providing the ""up to"" part is what I'm really getting). The ""Blast!"" internet, the highest non-bundle plan you can get at 150 mbps at 78.95 a month at its highest, only pays approximately $.53 per mbps. In what way is it fair that MY lower internet speed is being charged at a higher premium for using LESS of their system's power? It almost seems to me that Comcast is increasing MY premium to offset the difference and offer better deals to people who want the Blast! Internet. I'm paying five times more per product given and getting five times less product!
 The only other option is that Comcast can charge me more because Century Link, the only other ""major competitor"" in many area, only offers a 7mbps plan for 29.95 a month (entry fee). In which case, Comcast is taking advantage of monopolizing my city by jacking up the price of internet.
 In short, the shady business practices in their billing department need to be examined with a fine-tooth comb. If I was being charged the same premium as the ""Blast!"" customers, I would only be paying a paltry $13.25 per every mb alloted to me! In my mind, they've got two ways to make this fair: 1) lower the price of my package to more accurately reflect my usage, or increase the Blast! to my premium and make them pay $375 a month.

315602,Comcast deceptive selling billing lack of service - SECOND And EXPANDED COMPLAINT,5/31/2015,10:40:45 AM,Internet,Evans,Georgia,30809,Closed,No,"About 5/6 months ago I returned a HD box and one smaller box both with remote controls. I was told
 that the small box was not on my account and that they would have to investigate and get back with
 me NOTHING
 On May 19th I called about what specials you have with a triple play, The package I was offered
 included your new Xfinity 1 box, upgrade to 105 gb data, HO, Starz and Stream plex, also I could get
 additional Premium channels for only $2 more a month total package would be good for 2 years. The
 current phone modem would work for my system I said, let me call back tomorrow and Iâ€™ll confirm, the
 rep said he would attach the package to my account.
 On May 20th, I call and got some female in the Philippines. I said I called yesterday and there is a
 package attached to my account. She proceeded to ask me what the package was, then she said
 give me 2 minutes. When she came back the price increased, I said that was not right, Again she
 said give me 2 minutes, when she came back she had the right price but the wrong package again
 give me two minutes, now she got most of the package right, and again ask for 2 more minutes. She
 also said I needed a new modem, yet the prior rep said I did not. Finally after getting the initial
 package right and price right she stated that besides the price had to pay something like an additional
 $75, install and return. I said NO I am going to install by myself. Again give me 2 minutes after
 about a total 50 minutes on the phone she said that it was taken care of, but there were only a few
 minutes left for me to take the special discount. I locked in and she said the xfinity 1 box will be sent
 out 3-5 business days.
 I called back on May 21st to confirm, and spoke to a supervisor in Texas who said she would monitor,
 never hear or see anything from the supervisor.
 On May 22 I received my Comcast box, but it was another modem, I called and Comcast said they
 would send the right one out. In the mean time the DVR box I had lost channels and got worse every
 time I called. In addition my phone service went down again (this was frequent). Also same day, I
 spoke to Andre a supervisor from Columbia who tried to get my internet up, but no luck, he set up a
 service tech on May 26 for internet and DVR box.
 When the tech came out on May 26th, I spoke to him about the initial DVR box (over the phone, my
 wife was home). Needless to say he did nothing with the internet or DVR box. Later that day we
 received the Xfinity 1 box, I followed all directions, but when I went to register over the phone I kept
 getting busy signals. Finally I contacted Comcast again and she was able to register my Xfinity box.
 After going through the channels I only had the basic channels, so back on the phone to Comcast,
 Now I get Janiki from Alabama who was helpful in straightening out the issues. At this point I spent at
 least 5 hours on the phone and the internet was still not up. On May 28th, after 8 attempts I got
 through to the US and spent 2 hours getting the internet setup, during that time the US agent got
 someone from the Philippines (internet help) and again anther useless person, who spoke with a
 strong dialect, did not understand my questions and kept on saying letâ€™s go back and start again. The
 person from the US remained on the phone while all this was going on. After the internet was up and
 the person from the Philippines was gone, I told him that he resolved 99.9% of my issues and most
 likely would have solved all of them and a lot sooner without the person from the Philippines.
 I still have the issue of the last small box I returned and have other boxes to return. I am skeptical
 that if I ship them back using UPS I have no recourse and either Comcast will say that these boxes
 are not on my account or say they never ever received them. Now on May 30, 2015, my cable is
 finally up, phone is up and intermittent internet service. I was notified that my bill is $238.78, which I
 was total over the phone would be around $165 including taxes. It should also be less due to credits
 from the above returned item, prior issues of service not being available and once the new service
 was establish, it was not totally functioning. It appears that Comcast uses off shore personal to sell,
 but when billed the Comcast customer has to again deal with the off shore incompetence in getting all
 issues resolved. I currently have spent nearly 10 HOURS with my time and do not want to spent any
 more time."
342613,Comcast complaint about internet speed,6/16/2015,9:07:25 AM,Internet,Evans,Georgia,30809,Solved,No,"On 6/15/15 at 11:30 am I spoke to Comcast internet technical support about slow internet speed. I have been paying for 50 MBPS since 10/11/13. Right after the install I realized my old modem and router would not handle the increased speed, so on 10/18/13 I purchased a new docsis 3.0 gateway and installed it. I had to call Comcast at that time to tell them about my new gateway so that the signal would go through. The technical support person told me on 6/15/15 that Comcast never updated my modem and router information with the new one and that is why my internet speeds have never been near the 50 MBPS I am paying.
 My complaint is that I have been paying for the 50 MBPS and have not been receiving it since 10/18/13. I have tried to discuss a credit or something with Comcast I got the run around. I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told none were available at this time and that a supervisor would call me back, which never happened.

319816,Comcast (Chicago IL),6/2/2015,7:09:11 PM,Internet,Evanston,Illinois,60202,Solved,No,"I sign up for new service March 2015. When I received new equipment (for the second time), I returned all the product to their service center in Morton Grove IL. At the store (April 2015), I learned that Comcast created 2 ""new"" accounts for the same services (tv and internet). An apparent error on their behalf, the representative ""closed"" the account and made some ""follow up"" to ensure me that I would not be double billed. Well, not only was I billed in error by Comcast, they sent my ""disconnected"" unpaid bill to a Credit Management collection agency (855-657-8580). Because this is not my first time speaking to Comcast about billing issues with new service started in March 2015, I request a statement from Comcast to confirm that they were going to resolve this issue with the collection agency. A one month bill should have only been around $47 but the collection agency states that I owe Comcast $78. How could that be when I am a current customer and the error was brought to their attention the next month by me?
 The Comcast rep that I spoke to name was Will (ID 102787).

358340,Comcast Price Gouging,6/23/2015,1:28:17 PM,Internet,Everett,Washington,98201,Open,No,"I signed up for Comcast internet and television in June of 2013 and paid $80 for my services, the company has been relentlessly adding new charges and fees to my account without my permission or knowledge. At one point my bill reached $130, I called them and was able to negotiate the price down to $108 but it is steadily creeping upwards again. In addition to the price increases I am paying equipment fees which were hidden from me at the time that I purchased my service. My equipment fees total $10 a month for the television cable box. I was being charged $8 a month for the internet cable modem however I was able to purchase one that works with Comcast services. In order to set up my internet cable modem I had to call the company back three separate times in order for them to activate my own device, apparently they would rather have their customers rent their devices.
 If I had a choice between comcast and another cable company in the area I would choose to switch services however I do not have that luxury. Something needs to be done about this so Comcast can stop raising peoples rates without their knowledge or permission.

 I recently tried to cancel my cable bill since my costs were getting out of hand. Upon trying to cancel I was told that I could bundle my EXISTING services into one package for $79.99 a month. I agreed to this and was told that I would not lose any cable channels nor would I have a decrease in internet speeds. Unfortunately my internet speed dropped to 50down/10up where it was at 105down/15up before. The retention specialist lied to me and locked me into a 2 year agreement when I was promised to keep my existing internet speeds.

364765,Unable to renew IP address,6/25/2015,12:43:14 PM,Internet,Everett,Washington,98201,Solved,No,"I spoke with Comcast for an hour to get my public IP address renewed. The representative was unsure of how to do this and tried having me renew my private IP address. Upon being transferred to the highest tier technical support they were unable to release my DHCP assigned IP address either. This caused Three days of downtime and I was uncompensated for this. I can't believe that my cable company (whom I am leasing this IP address from) is unable to reset it.

 We replaced our router and had to wait (Although I was assured there would be no wait time) for a tech to come to the front of the house to add the proper services to our line (why was this necessary if I was always set up right?

 Hello,
 I wanted to share my experience I had with your Technical Support/Customer Service representatives (and managers). I have already contact the FCC and BBB about this service and hope that you see this as an opportunity to retrain the Comcast support staff. In my experience this past weekend I have talked to nearly 10 representatives and all but the staff at the Fairfield Comcast store California (they were incredibly friendly and helpful) were either not skilled in communications or in technical support.
 We have had an ongoing issue with our internet but was led to believe that the wireless modem was the issue in the slow speeds from our bedroom.

281647,Comcast will not service our home,5/9/2015,11:22:22 AM,Internet,Fall City,Washington,98024,Solved,No,"Comcast wants to charge me several thousand dollars to service the home we just bought. The home
 was previously serviced by CenturyLink with DSL and Direct TV, and all we wanted to do was add
 cable service when we moved in.
 The home is in a neighborhood, and all the neighbors surrounding the home have comcast cable.
 Each home sits on a 5 acre piece of property. So to reiterate, the home across the street has cable,
 the home behind me has cable, the home beside me has cable. But the previous owner who built this
 home 20 years ago, never hooked it up.
 When I reached out to have it installed, they quoted me some huge extra fee saying this home hadn't
 paid to have cable 20 years ago. They said the information they are using to make this decision is 14
 years old. Since then, all the neighbors have installed cable, so the line is here. (Please see attached
 plat map). All the parcels surrounding on the main road SE 8th have cable.
 Is this even legal?"

356818,Recurring Comcast service issues and long waits for non-service,6/22/2015,6:10:03 PM,Internet,Federal Way,Washington,98093,Solved,No,"We have Comcast ""business"" service because they are a local monopolist for non-DSL broadband. They are unable to resolve a recurring ""Security"" issue that they created by provisioning two business modems with identical static IP addresses. As a result of this issue, my business gets booted offline every two weeks when they push (misconfigured) software updates to the modems. This results in our startup business being offline for hours (and in an earlier instance 2 days) at a time where availability is critical to our survival.
 We apparently need to clean this problem up through their customer security department which is so understaffed, that wait times are up to 3 HOURS before their system summarily drops calls on hold.
 I would switch providers if I could, but see above - they're essentially a monopoly in the City of Bothell.

359812,Multiple billing an dcompetative issues.,6/23/2015,7:02:38 PM,Internet,Federal Way,Washington,98023,Pending,No,"I have multiple complaints about Comcast, my service provider:
 1. Our network speed that we get with Comcast is not what we pay for, its often much slower than the marketing and bills describe. As a result I cant help but feel lied to when i pay for one thing and get something significantly different.
 2. Our bills are often far too high and they refuse to lower them to fair levels; We find they have added a lot of junk fees at times, or simply increased prices without telling us or letting us say ""no"".
 3. It is not uncommon for me to find that they have billed me for services that I never agreed to accept.
 4. They have in the past attempted to bill me for my own hardware, and I have in the past had to pay to use my OWN EQUIPMENT.
 5. Unfair billing practices. In addition to the above its not uncommon to attempt to get these things fixed, only to be hung up on or outright told they refuse to assist me. They literally steal money form me every month and then say I'm in some sort of contract I never agreed to, that they can never give proof of.
 6. I have been forced to be a customer for years as they are a monopoly and nobody else services my area. I'm told that the reason for this is that Comcast will not ALLOW the competition when I ask other providers, and so as a result I am not able to use the providers I want to get 1gb fiber for my home as they are not allowed to service my area due to restrictions created by Comcast.
 7. I have overpaid them due to these issues and they refuse to refund my money when they should be.

 Comcast representative I can bring my old equipment and plug it in, upon doing so to call in to
 activate the new account and that would deactivate the old account. The same was done on
 04/13/15.
 Upon residing at our new address for several weeks the internet connection has been inconsistent
 and will not remain logged on for more than a few minutes at a time. I called to inquire about fixing the
 wireless router wherein was told it is still linked to the old account that has still not been deactivated. I
 called into Comcast 5 times after that on 05/16/15, 05/26/15 , 05/27/15, 05/28/15 and 05/29/15 which
 I have advised the situation and wanted to deactivate the account. I advised I have not received a bill
 for the new address, I am aware that I will owe money for the past month but did not want to incur
 more charges at an address where I no longer live or at my current address where the services aren't
 being provided. Out of the 5 calls I had made all representatives advised would review the matter and
 call me back, to date I have not received a call back, I have not received an email, I have not received
 a new bill nor have I received adequate service or an answer to my inquiry. I had spoken to DeSean-
 05/16/15 who advised to call back in 10 days to get a new bill and that all the services would be taken
 care of. I followed up on 05/26/15 and spoke with Don who advised the order was sent to a
 supervisor but still outstanding, he then indicated would escalate to his supervisor. On 05/27/15 I
 spoke with Tamika who advised there was no change and she would walk over to her supervisor to
 push through the deactivation and call me back. On 05/28/15 I spoke with Zaleena who indicated
 would review everything and call me back once she knew what was going on. On 05/29/15 I spoke
 with Carol who indicated she would review everything and get to the bottom of it and would call me
 back. Again, no call backs, no updates and I am still without a bill or consistent service for a product I
 am stuck with for two more years."

I then received a bill of $90.00 for two months of internet. Mind you, this internet isn't even high speed internet! I called and asked why the amount for regular internet was so expensive. They told me that my promotion was over. I said that there should have been some sort of warning. I do not want to pay $45.90 a month for basic internet. The representative then said sarcastically... didn't I receive my bill. I told him yes I did but I thought that this was an accident. He then told me that he would place me on another promotion for 6 months to a year. I do not understand if I had not had a query about my bill Comcast would have continued to charge me $45.90 a month for basic internet. Only when I became uspset about the bill did they offer another promotion. They are too expensive and they take advantage of customers that are not aware!!!!

 Please accept this as a formal complaint against Comcast Cable Company.
 My business has been a subscriber to Comcast high-speed Internet Service for the past 10 years. However, for reasons that are unrelated to this complaint my account number changed approximately 3 years ago.
 In January 2015 I upgraded my high-speed Internet service so I can operate my phone using a voice over Internet protocol provider. I switched from high-speed Deluxe 25 Plan to Deluxe 50 Planhigh-speed plan. With my new service I would be receiving 25 more megbytes of upload and to 40 more download megabytes.
 However these speeds we're only provided for for the initial month, January 2015.
 In February 2015 I experienced my Internet speeds both upload and download slowdown and my office was experiencing poor telephone sound quality on account of the speeds not being delivered. I contacted Comcast in the middle of February and explain to them the issue and I was told by a representative they were experiencing trouble in my area while it was not an outage this speeds were not being delivered as promised.
 I did not open a ticket because I was informed that since they were aware of the issue and it was affecting a wide variety of people it would be rectified soon. Sadly the problem continued all the way until March 2015 when I called a second time and expressed my displeasure that I was being billed for services not being provided for they explained since the problem is ongoing they cannot issue a credit until the problem is rectified and that I should call back.
 In April 2015 I called back and was informed by Comcast at the problem had been rectified, after 60 days. I asked about a refund and was told someone would get back to me. Nobody ever called me back. Last week the beginning of June 2015 when I called I was informed that I would not be getting a refund since I did not open a ticket however during my initial call I was informed I could not open a ticket.
 What is so frustrating about this situation is that during my initial calls representatives from Comcast informed me that my credit would be as a matter of course as opposed to something that would have to be approved by supervisor.
 I'm very frustrated since I really have no other choice but to pay Comcast even when they do not provide the services that I pay for, please help and thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.
 The last agent I spoke with was Javier in Texas with agent ID of 538-35.

350675,paying for WiFi and its not working,6/18/2015,9:04:04 PM,Internet,Flint,Michigan,48503,Solved,No,"I moved into my home April 1,2015. We could not pick up a signal on our mobile devics so we called Comcast and signed a two year contract to get WiFi in our home. I have an autistic 3 year old and he is obsessed with internet games and I have to be able to use my cell phone I almost daily have to connect through phone or text with his doctors, therapists, case managers and mant other people. The Comcast tech came to our house and hooked up our modem and helped us switch our cell phones so that calls would be made over our WiFi. People started telling me that they were calling me multiple times in a row and my phone would just go to voicemail my phone wasn't even ringing. Then a couple days later I would finally receive the voicemail. When we would try to make a call the person would tell us we were breaking up and they could only hear every other word, then the call would drop completely after about 3 minutes. I called Comcast and told them of my problem. They mailed me a more high tech midem which was supposed to have a 50 foot radius. We installed it and reconnected our devices still the same problems. We were also not able to connect to the internet it would almost always say no network available. Needless to say this sent my son into very unpleasant meltdowns. Once again I contact Comcast the transfer me to tech support. The tech tells me she is changing my internet to a much stronger channel and it should fix my problem well no it didn't. This last time I called they inform me they won't even talk to me about my problem until I pay them $150.00 which I really didn't want to do because I am paying for services I really didn't recieve. But I did go and pay because like I said this service is very vital to my family. When I called back I told them I think my account should be credited because I have paid for 3 months of a service I couldn't even use. The lady told me the best she could do was take off $16.00 from my bill. Then she transfered me to tech support once again. I was not home at this time and the tech lady told me that if I was unable to talk to her while standing at my modem to troubleshoot my problem then she couldn't help me. I explained to her that was impossible because of the breaking up and the call being dropped and she said that all she could do was tell me how to reset the modem and hopefully that would work. Needless to say I still don't have working WiFi.

360281,ISP Data Cap,6/23/2015,10:05:49 PM,Internet,Florence,Alabama,35630,Pending,No,"The data cap imposed by my internet service provider (Comcast Xfinity) is restricting my ability to do what I need to do on the internet. I am a full-time student on the GI Bill (USMC veteran, '08-'13), and the internet is my primary resource for completing homework, as well as learning via streaming video services. My brother is also a full-time student, earning a major in media editing - he also uses large amounts of bandwidth to complete his education. Between the two of us, we inevitably exceed our data cap every month and are forced to pay a ridiculous overage charge. We have no other options, as all ISP's in our area impose data caps. I have paid an internet bill of over $220 for one month, despite my plan costing only $29.95 / month. It is ridiculous that ISP's are allowed to do this to their customers.
 This data cap is interfering with the education benefits that I earned by serving our country. It is also affecting my family's education. Please do something about this.

333174,Internet Connection and Speed Issues,6/10/2015,4:06:07 PM,Internet,Forest Grove,Oregon,97116,Solved,No,"We are paying $95 per month for Comcast Preferred Xfinity Double Play TV and Internet that ""supposedly"" comes with internet speeds of at least 25 mbps download and 5 mbps upload. We have hardly been getting such speeds, when we have been able to connect to the internet at all. For almost the past year we have been having problems with the overall internet connectivity, such as being online and the internet going down for hours at a time. Our modem and router both show that there is still an internet connection available and working, but no device in our house is able to connect to the internet. We have tried countless times to reset the modem, contacted Comcast about it, and have gotten nowhere, with the problem seemingly getting worse if anything. This is our last resort to try and get this problem fixed in a civil manner, and sadly if this does not work we are going to have to find a new service provider, as we are tired of the poor service being provided by Comcast. I hope that this complaint will help to address the problem that has been occurring with Comcast's Xfinity Internet service not just in our own home, but in other homes that receive the Xfinity Internet service in our area as well.

I've been with Comcast for Alittle over a year now and I'm quickly learning that it's not all its cracked up to be. I was say that they are in fact a lot worse than a lot of different internet providers I've been with. I think it's pretty ridiculous that they have to have a data cap especially as low as 300gb which is outrageous especially since Comcast pays little to nothing for unlimited data yet charges customers a arm and a leg for just a little sliver of the pie and don't forget data cap included. Best part about this is the fact that lately it seems our internet reaches the limit much faster now and my family has not changed much of what they do on the internet but why the change? Why is it just now we are having these issues with trying to keep under our limits. To top it all off when i call to fibd out what change is in my usage and how to help minimize my usage, i pretty much get a we cant help you. What I'm trying to say is its ridiculous and I'm getting to the point where I'm seriously looking into another provider because its to the point where its not worth the prices hassle and data cap anymore.

 My Father-in-law lives less than two miles outside of Fort Collins, Colorado on County Road 5. Fort Collins hosts a population of 152,061 (2013) and a large public university (Colorado State University). Yet the only internet service available to him is Verizon OTA service which he must pay a ridiculous premium for 15 GB a month. This is an infuriating failure of the large providers to expand their network as population centers grow.

I would change Internet providers but Comcast runs what seems to be a monopoly in my area with the only speeds that seem to be up to my needs. I wouldn't have as much of a problem but I have had multiple providers and they seem to be the most expense and most problematic. I have had terrible service with my Internet not working and gone through 4 different modem/routers in less than a year.

 Speeds were great when we were upgraded to the new modem. They were verging on about 130 megabits which is fine. I understand that you can't always hit your top speeds. But not even 2 weeks later, I noticed speeds were much slower than Comcast promised.
 Now I run speed tests maybe 2 months after we upgraded our internet, and I can never get anywhere close to 150 megabits. It always seems to cap at 30 which is completely unacceptable. It's frustrating how Comcast thinks they can get away with this. I won't even go into detail about how slow our internet was before we upgraded. All I'll say is that is was far slower than what we were paying for.

366894,Systemic failures with Comcast,6/25/2015,7:32:10 PM,Internet,Fort Lauderdale,Florida,33312,Solved,No,"I have never dealt with a company whose practices reflect a level of dishonesty that comes close to what I've experienced with Comcast over the past two months.
 On May 6, I had a past due balance of $33.77 on a total bill of $79.86, and was facing a service shut off, so I called Comcast to ask for an extension, which I received, having promised to make at least a $33.77 payment by May 12. My confirmation number for that agreement was 028830165. Despite this payment agreement my service was shut off the very next day, May 7. When I called to complain, also referencing my confirmation number, my service was restored, and I also insisted on a confirmation that I not be charged a re-connection fee, since the service never should have been turned off. I was promised a re-connection fee would not be assessed, with reference #028898116. I made a payment of $40.00 on May 12. I also subsequently checked my outstanding balance and ascertained that I'd been charged a re-connection fee from May 7. I called and had the fee removed.
 Then on June 6, with no notice at all, my service was disconnected. I called Comcast, which apologized and turned my service back on based on an agreement - confirmation #5643VD8 - to pay $28.93 via an automatic transfer from my checking account on June 20. Only after providing my checking information was I advised I'd be assessed a $5.99 ""convenience charge"" for making this agreement, which I was forced into if I wanted my service restored, service which had been shut off without notice! Three days after making this agreement I received a call from Comcast threatening me again with a service stoppage despite my agreement from three days earlier. I spoke to a Jennifer, ID #J6S, who apologized for the internal communications disconnect, and guaranteed my service would stay on and that my agreement from June 6 was still in place. On June 20, early in the day and then again at about 11pm EST, I checked my checking account activity and noticed no charge or pending charge for the $28.93 which I thought would automatically be deducted on that day, per the June 6 agreement. I called Comcast, and they confirmed that no deduction had been made. I spoke with operator ID#LA101045 with whom I made clear that I subsequently would make the $28.93 payment via Comcast's automated system but I wanted a guarantee that I wouldn't be double-billed the $28.93. I felt I needed to cover myself and make that payment as I'd agreed I would back on June 6, so that my service wouldn't be stopped. I immediately made the payment $29.93 after speaking with the customer service person, and my confirmation of payment number is F0AAB10. Earlier this week, on June 23, I discovered that despite Comcast's promise not to double-bill me, they double-billed me anyway. I have requested that my bank, Wells Fargo, reverse Comcast's charge against my checking account. I believe that aside from the horrible internal lack of communication at Comcast, they have now crossed a line and committed outright extortion or fraud, based on charging me after promising me that I wouldn't be double-billed. I'm disgusted with this company, and I hope you can do something to force them to change their very customer unfriendly practices and fix their internal communications breakdowns. Thanks.

 To whom it may concern:
 The following email was received by me, and a voice message left for me on the same day from a Comcast employee on June 30, but after multiple attempts on my part to respond by phone there has been no further effort by this person, Roger A., to contact me. My feeling is that they're just going through the motions:
 ""Good Afternoon Jeff Weinberger, At Comcast we strive to provide outstanding customer service and we appreciate you brining your concerns to our attention. I attempted to reach you at 954-839-5376; I left a message with my contact information. Unfortunately our attempts to reach you have been unsuccessful; please contact me via phone or email so we can discuss your concerns and come to a timely and satisfactory resolution. Best Regards, Roger A.Executive Customer RelationsComcast CorporateOffice: (954) 534-7220Office Hours: M-F: 11am â€“ 8pm""
 The statement that their attempts to reach me ""have been unsuccessful"" is misleading since there were only two attempts, one by email, one by phone, both on June 30. To reiterate, my three attempts to call them back since I received these two communications have not been reciprocated. This company needs to get its act together and be sanctioned. They've caused me undue stress and hours of wasted time on the phone thanks to their blunders and dishonesty. I hope the FCC will act accordingly on my behalf. Thank you...

While he detailed charges for various unwarranted service charges as well as late fees that he would be deducting from my account balance, a week later - as of today - he still has not provided in writing via email or snail mail a document detailing those deductions, as he told me he would. Unless his promises are documented for me in writing, they're of little use and (b) (6)
 (b) (6)
 validity. In my opinion this failure is just a continuation of Comcast's terrible customer service, this time coming from one of their customer service executives. Thank you...
 From: FCC <consumercomplaints@fcc.gov>

232276,Comcast internet and lack of communication and response,4/13/2015,1:40:31 PM,Internet,Fort Myers,Florida,33919,Closed,No,"Internet service has been out April 9, 2015 until present (April 13, 2015). Comcast only gives 'run-around' and claims to be fixing problem. Every update gives a time it will be resolved by, and when that time approaches , they change the time. Supervisors who promise call backs with additional information, never call back. Comcast refuses to acknowledge how many customers are affected. For all we know, this outage may continue for days or weeks....with no accountability to customers. Customers have to call for credit on next bill, or Comcast does not credit them for their outage. Requests for phone numbers/addresses for consumers to elevate their questions, complaints, concerns...are denied (""we don't have that to give to you""). Basically the comcast customer is kept in the dark.

She contacted Comcast and they said they would refund the money within 72 hours but she would need to provide a letter from her bank. The letter would have to be on bank letterhead and state she didnâ€™t request a stop payment on the check. Comcast also needed the bank to state the amount of $128.22 and check #0409. She was working with Comcast Executive Relations and the reps name was Jasmine Valez. Now she canâ€™t contact the rep since 4/14/15 and she has left messages and no return call.

 Follow-up message by Consumer on 4/16/2015 6:10:24 PM:
 Please add to my complaint, Ticket No. 238647, that I spoke with Ms, Jazmine Valez today and was informed that though she thought that the accounting department could reverse that electronic draft withdrawal and refund the $128.22 that was taken from my account clearly in error, she was advised that the collections department that makes payment arrangements is a third party sub contractor and not actually a department within Comcast and because the arrangement that was made was technically a ""check"", they would not be able to reverse the transaction but would have to issue me a paper check which could take in excess of 2 weeks for me to receive!
 Ms. Valez stated that she was shocked by this response and contacted her manager which gleaned the same result. She said that as she, too is a customer of Comcast that she found this to be unacceptable and was surprised that no exception would be made as this was clearly the fault of the contractor they hired to make payment arrangements.
 Ms. Valez suggested that I contact my bank to see if they could process a dispute or a stop payment which could result in me getting my money refunded faster. I contacted my bank and it was explained to me that they could not issue a stop payment because the check already cleared and that the only thing they could do is a dispute of payment affidavit which would take 60 days to process.
 I just want my funds returned to my account. The collections person that I made my payment arrangement with never once identified themselves as a third party contractor. This would explain why when I asked to be transferred to the collections department that every representative (even the billing department) stated that they had no contact phone number for that ""department"" as they only
 make out going calls, not the honest answer that they really are not part of Comcast at all. So who exactly did I give my personal banking information to? I had to borrow money today to cover other expenses that I had today because of this.
 I just want my money returned electronically because it was withdrawn that way and I no longer want service with Comcast because I am more uncomfortable now than I was before with the way my banking and personal information has been grossly mishandled. Ms. Valez has been wonderful however, no one beyond her is motivated to correct this error.

320644,Comcast knowingly over billed,6/3/2015,11:38:03 AM,Internet,Fort Myers,Florida,33908,Closed,Yes,"Comcast knowingly over billed me again. I recently sent a complaint and not only had conversations with them, but proved to them in writing their billing me for a service call was incorrect. Their latest bill did not remove the charges and they refuse to remove them. Additionally, they added a late fee (which could have an effect on my credit). This has been a continuous struggle with Comcast. I am asking the FCC not only to get involved and stop just sending this to Comcast to resolve... because they don't... but to fine Comcast for continuously putting customers through this horrendous activity, wasting peoples time and costing them money to resolve issues. Now they say I am being charged a late fee for their mistake. My Gosh... When will someone from the FCC actually help!!! Comcast is horrible and you know it... but you do nothing!!!

336872,Horrible/Unacceptable Service of Comcast,6/12/2015,12:45:46 PM,Internet,Fort Myers,Florida,33907,Solved,No,"Hello,
 I am having so many issues with my Comcast internet service. I am writing here in detail:
 1. Getting Service: I ordered Comcast service on 9th May. After chatting with them for an hour i purchased $39.99 monthly internet plan. Then I gave them all my information and after half hour they said this plan is no longer available, So after talking 1.5 hour i gave up on them. But finally they said this service is back on. So i bought $39.99 plan. I din't receive any confirmation about my purchase via email. I order self installation kit with no on-site technician service.
 2. After few days i received automated call from Comcast saying, We have apportionment for on site technician tomorrow. I had to call them to cancel the appointment as i din't order this service which cost $100 on first note. it was half hour troublesome call because they din't have my account number.
 3. Activating Service: Once shipment arrived, i self installed everything and tried to activate service online but couldn't do it. I called them again, they din't able to track my account number which i gave them. They kept rolling me from one department to another. Finally after 1.5 hour they able to activate my service. I also received set up box for TV for local channels, which i plugged into TV but I am not getting any channels.(I don't really care about cable because i don't use their service).
 4. I prepared online profile on their website. here i found my confirmation email for service, it says $44.99 service instead of $39.99 service. My online profile still says, i don't have activated service. Now the worst part comes, i received my first bill. Which says i have $54.99 plan plus they charged my for $9.99 for self activation kit. First i called billing department, they informed me you have $54.99 service which you need to pay. I explained them every situation but they din't agree and transferred me to customer service they told me you can get $49.99 plan now. I tried to convince them this is unfair, but they said this is the only option we can do. They said $39.99 service is no longer available, which is wrong because i told them that you still have that service on website, which is apparently in $29.99 now. They finally transfer me to sales department. Again I had to explain every details and again i received same reply. Finally they HANG UP. I called again to billing department and explained them again, Luckily this time they said everything is taken care. you have $39.99 plan now and you will receive confirmation in another 24 hours. I din't receive any confirmation so i contact them via online chat. They din't track my account first so transfer me to another department i explained them all situation over again & again they said somebody will call me in another 48 hours, Also gave me ticket number.
 Finally i din't hear anything from Comcast and I am here to write my complain. Please help me with issue.
 Thanks.

340024,Comcast overcharge,6/14/2015,4:01:56 PM,Internet,Fort Myers Beach,Florida,33931,Open,No,"I have had internet service with Comcast since December 2014. In May, I lost internet service and it could not be restored remotely. A repairman was scheduled and I was told I would not be charged for his visit. I received a bill on June 4, 2015 that showed a $50 charge for the repairman's visit. I called Comcast billing and was told the charge would be removed. (reference # 029438591). On June 13th, I went online to pay the bill and saw the charge for the repairman's visit was not removed. It appears to me the $50 charge was reduced by about $10. I immediately called the Comcast billing department. The customer service representative could not reduce the bill. She told me a supervisor would call me within 24 hours. (Of course, I have not received a call and I doubt I ever will). I am paying the bill because I want to maintain my good credit rating. However, I believe I am entitled to be reimbursed for the amount I am being charged for the repairman's visit. This was not a new install. This was the repair of internet service with an existing customer. It does not make sense that I should be paying for a service and also have to pay the company to fix its own problem. I would very much appreciate it if you would look into this matter.
 My address is , Fort Myers Beach, FL 33931. Thank you.

213506,Internet Provider Data Thresholds,4/2/2015,8:09:54 AM,Internet,Franklin,Tennessee,37064,Closed,No,"Data thresholds are set artificially low. I live in the Nashville area and Comcast Xfinity has a data threshold of 300 GB per month. After that, the consumer is charged $10 per 50 GB. 300 GB is a ridiculously low threshold in the age of streaming music, video and watching content - especially at HD quality that most households use. My family of five easily exceeds that with watching a few favorite shows on Netflix, Hulu and iTunes movies.
 The last couple of months, my Internet overage charges equalled my contract price. Most of the country does not have overage charges yet this is a stated plan on Comcast's website to potentially roll this out nationwide.
 If anything, the use of data threshold seems designed to get you to buy expensive cable packages that no longer reflect consumer interests. I was also offered Comcast's streaming service that competes with Netflix but it also consumes data.
 The only unlimited data package from Comcast is a very expensive one through their business unit.
 Data thresholds are costly to consumers and dis-incentives people from using the Internet for content, research, exploration and learning. There is no issue of congestion and there is certainly little to no investment of new fiber lines for those who are paying these exorbitant rates.

 threatening overage fees."
288851,Comcast Data Caps,5/13/2015,8:45:21 PM,Internet,Franklin,Tennessee,37064,Open,No,"I current have internet service with Comcast and last month my bill was $70 dollars more than normal
 because of a data cap that they impose on customers. As there are no internet providers in my area
 that offer service without a cap I am powerless to move to a provider that does not have this ""added
 bonus"". I would implore the FCC to please look into data caps and their effects on consumers in
 areas where there is no choice. This effects people like myself more now because media like video
 and games have become so much larger in recent years with some games now using one fifth (50gb)
 of my data cap or more in some cases. Unfortuntately, this means that I am basically punished (read
 taxed) when I spend money on these types of purchases which can cause my cap to be breached
 and extra money to be paid to Comcast. This also stifles the economy by keeping people from
 spending as much money on such media so that they don't have to pay more to their internet
 provider."
305720,Comcast,5/25/2015,11:09:23 AM,Internet,Franklin,Tennessee,37067,Pending,No,"Comcast has implemented usage based billing in the Nashville area in the face of no broadband
 competition. The only local competitor is ATT - their footprint is smaller, services less well developed,
 and in my case not available due to my geographic location. Essentially for me, Comcast has a
 monopoly on high-speed internet services.
 It is egregious they are implementing this cap with no clear justification other than the desire to
 increase their profits as more online services continue to develop. This will stifle innovation, even as
 there is no competition.
 The method by which they are doing this is also problematic. Comcast plans come with an initial data
 cap of 300GB/mo. It offers a $5 discount from your monthly bill to lower your data cap to 5GB/mo.
 However for each 50GB over 300GB, they charge $10. Thus there is also a significant difference
 between increasing and decreasing your data cap.
 Moreover, there are neighter options for a home plan with an increased cap, nor unlimited home
 plans.
 It seems that the inconsistent pricing of data coupled with an existent monopoly is a consumer issue
 worthy of the FCC's investigation."
331090,Comcast data cap,6/9/2015,4:57:42 PM,Internet,Franklin,Tennessee,37064,Solved,No,"Data caps are making the internet way too costly, for today's routine use.
 While charging overage fees, there's no way to verify their measurements of data usage are accurate. Also, they offer no help in determining how much data different applications are using, so you could budget your usage.
 Please make them remove the caps or allow competition.

371119,Comcast business keeps moving my same-day trouble appointment to the next day,6/28/2015,4:48:51 PM,Internet,Franklin,Tennessee,37069,Open,No,"This is the 3rd time I have called for help regarding intermittent connection issues for my business internet. All 3 times, my appointment, which was supposed to be same day, was moved to the next day without my consent. This most recent time, I called back twice because it was nearing the end of the day and the CSR said that someone had changed the appointment to the next day. The CSR apologized and was perplexed. The CSR sent a note to local dispatch as a priority is what I was told, and I was told that a tech would be there. Again, when I called back around 7pm, I was told that someone had gone in and changed the appointment to the next day.
 On a previous incident of intermittent internet problems, the tech never showed at all. I stayed home that afternoon and night waiting on a technician to come. The issue corrected itself, but rather than call back in, I wanted to see how long it would take for comcast to call me and follow up. Two weeks later, I got an email to do a survey, so I assume that someone finally closed the ticket.
 I have now wasted valuable work and personal time and I am very frustrated. I will say that the tech Brian that arrived this time was professional and worked hard to resolve the issue. I am not waiting on a new cable to be installed and buried to permanently resolve the issue rather than someone simply leaving filters to take on and off to experiment when I had trouble with internet.

At 730 pm I was told the next available appointment is 6 days from now and a tech would call if they can make it sooner. I spoke with a supervisor who said they can't get in touch with dispatch so he would elevate my call but could not guarantee that someone would be out before June 24. I have several feet of cable line laying in my yard and some of it is badly frayed. Comcast is the most expensive provider with the most incompetent customer service.

In September, I return shipped the HD DVR box using a prepaid UPS label provided by Comcast. However, since the downgrade in June, I have been charged $10/mo for HD television upgrade, $10/mo for an additional outlet service that has not been used since 2012, and $10/mo for HD DVR services. I have contacted Comcast on 4 different occasions, most recently on June 16, 2015, and have been told they will investigate the issue and respond to me with a resolution. My issue has not been resolved. In fact, when I contacted customer service last week and requested a supervisor review my ticket, I was told that ""Managers are in meetings all day on Tuesdays"" and so there was nobody to escalate the issue to.
 The amount overcharged is now exceeding $300. I have paid each bill, in full and on time, since 2010 when we began service with Comcast. I am requesting a refund for all extra charges.

361633,Unfair Comcast Billing,6/24/2015,12:21:50 PM,Internet,Freeport,Illinois,61032,Open,No,"I have been attempting to downgrade my internet for two weeks now as I feel the $75/mo for 50mbps is a ridiculous amount to pay. The first time I attempted to downgrade, Comcast called me several times but only left a message once with an unclear message. I called back once, but I got no answer. I also picked up once, and no one talked when I answered. What they failed to tell me was that my order would be cancelled if I didn't talk to them.
 After seeing that my order was cancelled, I made several attempts to reorder my simple order (downgrade to 25mbps internet for $25 and add basic local cable for $10 per month.. a total of $35). First thing I noticed was that I was being charged $10 per month for modem rental, but had no way of removing the rental charge despite there being an edit link that made it seem like removing the charge was possible. Second, I noticed I was being charged an installation fee, a fee that wasn't there in my previous order. I attempted to rectify all of this via live chat. I told them my issue when I entered live chat. The live chat asked me a bunch of questions, and then told me that they can not do downgrades via live chat.
 So I put my order through, with the hopes of talking to Comcast about the extra charges. They call a few times as they did before, without leaving any messages. I was finally able to get them on the line, and they tell me that the package I was attempting to order (25mbps internet for $25/mo as long as I add a cable package, and I was adding the $10/mo local cable). They told me that this package was not available to me, despite their website telling me otherwise (I was even signed in when I did this, so it should be showing me exactly what is available to me). What they countered with was a more expensive package that offered me almost identical (25mbps internet plus basic cable) but with a package that would go up in price after 12 months and then again after 24 month. Additionally what they failed to make clear is that the local package is in standard definition and that there would be extra charges for converter boxes for hd.
 I find all of this to be unacceptable. As you can see in the picture provided, I attempted to order the 25mpbs internet + local tv for $35/mo. I was told this wasn't available. I am apparently able to order a nearly identical package (but has HBO, which I don't want) for $50/mo for 12 months.

 I know I contacted you that everything was resolved. Well, comcast called back and told me again that they could not give me that offer. A man named Ralph , who said that he was from Comcast Corp office called me today. He told me that he could not give me that offer unless i rent a modem from then or purchase another modem. He was rude on the phone. Since he call came through ""unknown"" I asked for his phone number. First he refused and then he said it depends on why I need his number. He gave me the number 410-931-5222.
 I just received another call from someone at Comcast. Now they again offered to send me a modem. I told him after all the hassle that I was to just cancel everything as of Monday June 22, 2015. I had to tell him that at least 7-9 times. (b) (6)
 Thank you for what you have done for me. I do hope you understand why I've decided to cancel it all and go with another company. I feel like I have tried with them. Again thank you very much.

 Dear Sir, madam,
 I received a call from Tenika from Comcast, she promised to reduce the monthly rate to $29.99 + tax. And she said you have a balance forward for $66 from the previous account. I asked her for the bill that I owed this money. They never provided me with one
 I don't owe them any balance from the previous account.
 And on the contrary, they added new charges to my account. And they never reduced the monthly rate.
 And I'm enclosing a copy of their bill. To show that they are playing games and they have no intention to resolve this issue.
 Would you please help stop deceptive trade.

 Finally in Mid January the problem was solved and I had phone and internet service. In the meantime, comcast kept billing me for service I did not receive.
 I have spent an untold number of hours on the phone and internet chats trying to solve the electronical problems as well as the billing. In February they gave me a credit of $95 and some old cents, I have now payed them three
 payments $85.80, $98.29,$72.55. But I have a current bill of $213.00.
 I contend that I should not be charged for the 3 months I did not have service and a $95 credit would mean my service was only $30+ a month. If I should pay the full amount that they require. I would be paying over $400 for 3 months of service. I did have a technician come to my home in February but I was told by him and a comcast phone person that I would not be charged for the call since they tried to help me over the phone and they could not.
 Please help me with this problem since I fear they will discconect my services.
 I am a 76 year woman living alone.
 Also when I got my internet back my folders disappeared. They had not helped me with that problem. On March 12 they erased all of my inbox emails.
 They have done nothing to locate the folders or the emails.
 I had a internet chat with an Ami and a supervisor ,Inna, on April 7 and asked for a transcript of the chat I was told to fill out the survey and at the end I would have the option of having the transcript emailed to me. I did the survey
 but there was not an option to have the transcript emailed . All I got after the survey was an opportunity to purchase additional service.

Once again, this is very upsetting to me that I would experience such poor customer service from Comcast especially after I just had major surgery in June 2015. I informed Comcast that I am disabled since October 28, 2014 and never adjusted my bill which my income had decreased, it matters about the increase of my monthly bill since a disabled person canâ€™t get any assistance in this matter. In May before my surgery, I had an issue with the price which was $114.88 then $24.42 for approximately three months March to May and June it rise up to $39.85 and I was informed by Comcast customer representative to call the Franchise in Montgomery County. This was totally unacceptable because if I have a question about a price I should be able to get that information from a Comcast representative. Secondly, to obtain phone records, I went through a lot to obtain that information. Stacey, executive customer care who never been helpful to me states that she canâ€™t give that information. I have a right to my phone information and being a persistent customer I finally got that information with no problem. In addition, Comcast tech comes to my house totally disrespect me in my home in front of guest only to answer my guest question about her cable and didnâ€™t assist me with my cable internet which I called for tech service. That same evening I had to call Comcast technical service they helped me over the phone with my internet service. As I complained about these issues, Stacey Executive customer care have not been helpful but give me several excuses why not to help me with no resolutions which I continued to complain to receive satisfactory results. I am still having problems with my internet that is slow or cut off which I calls technical service rapidly.
 Now my bill is $139.85, I called customer service to find out what happen. The customer service rep told me that I received a loyalty discount which I never informed as he continued he couldnâ€™t answer my question. I requested a supervisor and Dennis (Supervisor) called me back with a sarcastic attitude that Comcast made a mistake on the prices that my price $139.85 had always been the price I always had. I asked so why I am being targeted about the mistake, I was very upset with his sarcastic told telling me any answers that he thought would be satisfactory. Now Comcast is raising my service to repay back for their mistake is unacceptable, this is what was told to me by the customer care supervisor Dennis. Please listen to his tape recorded message today ticket number #02850199."

When we upgraded from a 50mbps package (hard capped at 30mbps), we could magically reach the previously unobtainable speed of 60mbps. I don't believe for a second that it is a hardware* bottleneck since Comcast offers a 250mbps package; rather, I feel that we (and all other customers in the area) are being taken advantage of and being pushed into upgrading our packages just to reach the speeds we were promised in our current tier.
 We just want the speeds we're paying for.

After filing my last complaint, I was contacted by Comcast through text message and they told me they had credited my account and I had a negative balance of $19.59. I had requested several times to establish a consistent amount for my services. They did not respond. I came home last night to find that my services were again shut off. When I called their customer service number, after being transferred 3 times and left on hold for 28 minutes, I was informed that I have a balance due of $801.00. I do not know where to turn. This situation has caused me severe emotional upset and distress. They told me I was being charged with a $500.00 early termination fee plus an additional $300.00 that they could not explain. I did not terminate my agreement. I took a stand after 18 months of overpayment and being lied to by their representatives over 40 times. I finally stopped paying until they would rectify my issues. I thought they had done so on January 31st. It seems they can never be taken at their word.. I have all the text messages from them that prove what I am saying to you.

257446,Nightly service interruption,4/25/2015,10:29:56 PM,Internet,Gallatin,Tennessee,37066,Closed,No,"I have had this problem since the end of the December. My Internet speed is 50 Mbps download and 10 Mbps upload and what happens is at night around 5:00 pm my Internet speeds drop anywhere from 1-10 Mbps. The first tech came out in the middle of the day and thought he fixed it but that night the problem was still there. The second tech came out at night and experienced the problem but could not fix it. He told me he would call me back the next day with more info but when I didn't hear from him I scheduled a third tech. The day the 3rd tech was supposed to come out the ""tech ops supervisor"" called me and said the problem isn't inside my house and would have the maintenance crew come out and check the lines.
 So in the second week of January the maintenance crews determined that our neighborhood needed a node split. That same supervisor said it would be done within a couple of weeks. After it never getting done he kept telling me it would be soon. Then in the middle of March he said their maintenance crew told him that it is not scheduled until the end of the 3rd quarter.
 I have talked to a lot of other people in my neighborhood and they are experiencing the same problem and they have also had Comcast out for this issue. This is a daily is sure that I see Comcast doing nothing to fix. So is Comcast just expecting all of us to wait up to nine months with horrible Internet service at night?

282011,comcast wont service my address,5/9/2015,3:47:52 PM,Internet,Gary,Indiana,46404,Solved,No,"I signed up for internet service with Comcast and they mailed me out all the equipment needed to
 install internet. The day I received the equipment I installed it myself but once I called to have the
 service activated they started to give me the run around.At first they said I owed a outstanding bill and
 until I payed it I couldn't get any service. I payed what they said I owed and called back to then have
 my service activated to no avail. I kept getting transferred from one department to another till finally
 one of the reps tells me my address is nonserviceable due to someone having a bill that was not paid.
 I askedwhat that had to do with me. I stistill didn't get anywhere. I later called back and got another
 rep that said all I had to do was go to one of the Comcast offices and show my I'D and they would
 service me. I did that and they still refused me service saying someone had a previous bill at my
 address. I said once again what does that have to do with me.They said finally the person had the
 same last name as me. I said so cause you have the same last name means I know this person or
 have to be kin to them they said yes.I was so heated that I just returned their equipment and left. I
 called again explained the situation to another rep she claimed that they could now service my home
 but she lied because I was suspicious of how fast things had changed so I called another rep to
 confirm what she was saying but the rep repeated my address was nonserviceable due to past tenant
 bill. I don't think this is fair or ethical the way Comcast does business. You always get told different

266403,Xfinity/comcast Service,4/30/2015,1:13:47 PM,Internet,Germantown,Maryland,20876,Closed,No,"I recently moved from Washington, DC to Germantown Maryland. So my initial contact to have my service moved from DC to MD was not a problem, it is the following issue that is now causing me to have to file a compliant against Comcast/Xfinity. While I do have cable service and I am promptly receiving a bill but unfortunately, I can not get anyone from IT to fix the problem that Comcast/Xfinity has caused, with regarding the accessing ""my"" own account online. On April 17, 2015 I called for two separate reasons my bill update and account changes. My billing issue was resolved and they were able to correct without issue but the second concerning my account being locked online was a little confusing. After several tickets were entered, no return calls from the IT specialist (Janae) that was supposed to be handling my ticket (her ext number is 18649) I guess decided she didn't want to return my call or wasn't. So I called again on 4/27 at 6:04pm EST, spoke with Sherita, ID F7Q, and she explained that in order to unlock my Comcast account due to the original IT technician set up an email account () making this email the primary account without providing me with a PIN number or password to access it. I explained several times to each technician that I wanted to keep my original email address that I created and password (which was explained that it would NO problem) it has still not been fixed. NOR was anything mailed to me to explain that this was done. So Sherita explained that since they can not verify who I was over the phone, they could not change nor provide me with a PIN to change the account settings. Even though during their prompts and live conversation at initial hook up, they ask for you to verify the name on account, last 4 digits of SSN, home address and your account number. So if I can set up a new account without being in-person and over the phone why can't they provide me the PIN number to correct the mistake that their own people created in order for me to access my account and pay my bill? Sherita also stated that a supervisor would be calling me within 2 hours of the time of my call, the date of this conversation was on (4/27), today is April 30th and I still have yet to receive a 2 hour call back. Some supervisor, and I still have not received my PIN in the mail.

I own my own small business and with Internet access I can work from home several days a week. I must use the Internet to access and conduct my business. Because of the immense opportunity the Internet provides, my husband also can work from home a few days a week as opposed to having to travel across the country. Having a 300gb data cap put on my household is limiting not only my family from the freedom to access the Internet and ability to choose what programming they choose to watch; it puts constraints on an entrepreneurial spirit. Whether it is entertainment or conducting their own personal business via a the Internet, applying data cap limit by Comcast forces me as a consumer to purchase Comcast cable programming for entertainment choices. With the advances in the high quality of movies, gaming opportunities, all of which need to be downloaded plus online radio/musical access, in addition managing our family's financial position, 300gb/month data is eaten up quickly. In today's world, TV, movies, telephone, music and personal financial planning all use data. Capping the data per house is backwards in a world moving full steam ahead.

This was all without our agreement or acknowledgement. We've dealt with the annoying phone calls letting us know we're close to our limit for months now but it recently got much worse. Our usual $80 bill was $250! Logging onto our account we saw that Comcast charged us $170 in overage fees. The first 3 reps said it would be taken off as a courtesy. When it still wasn't resolved I contacted them again to get a different story. They were very quick to tell us to stop watching Netflix if we didn't want to pay the higher bills. Not only would they not adjust our bill they suggested we upgrade service and use their version of Netflix to keep from going over. If my husband wasn't in grad school and needing the internet I wouldn't worry with it. But as it stands we are set to send an entire week's pay to Comcast to cover fees. How is this fair to us or Netflix? Why are we being punished by not buying a more expensive package? The whole thing just doesn't seem right at all. Please help.

 Mario S. of Comcastâ€™s Chicago Region Executive Care has responded to my FCC complaint (see below). While Comcastâ€™s Mario S. accurately restated my current billing situation, his response does not explain or justify Comcast raising my cable and internet 41% one month after I became a Comcast customer. Making my senior community a single provider situation and then exploiting this monopoly is wrong and should be prevented.
 My neighbor (from three doors down the floor) told me that when she was forced into taking the landlordâ€™s bulk cable package (as we all were) for $45.00 a month (as we all pay); Comcast continued to provide her internet for $19.95 a month. When I was forced to take the landlordâ€™s bulk cable package, Comcast started charging me almost as much for internet ($53.95) as they had been charging me for cable and internet ($69.95).
 At a minimum, this consumer would like a justification from Comcast for their 41% exploitation. Sincerely,

 Good afternoon
 I am in receipt of your billing complaint with the FCC. On behalf of Comcast and the Executive Care Office, I would like to apologize for any inconvenience and/or frustration we may have caused while working to resolve your issue. It is never our intention to make the resolution process difficult.
 I thoroughly reviewed your account and confirmed the video portion on your account is included with your association. Additionally I confirmed the account subscribes to performance internet at $53.95. There is also a monthly charge of $10 for the modem rental fee. The modem price increased from $8 to $10 in January 2015 with Comcastâ€™s company rate adjustment. The details of the rate adjustments was included in your December 2014 statement (attached).
 While we continue to make investments in our network and technology to give customers more for their money, including having made 12 speed increases in 14 years, offering the fastest indoor and outdoor XFINITY WiFi connection speeds on our latest advanced Wireless Gateway and offering nearly 8 million total XFINITY WiFi hotspots, we periodically need to adjust prices due to the increases and improvements we make with these new technologies. As always, you can opt to purchase your own router and modem, and we provide a list of devices that we have certified will work with our service at http://mydeviceinfo.comcast.net/.

 Follow-up message on 6/18/2015 5:32:38 PM:
 Dear FCC,
 Mario S. of Comcastâ€™s Chicago Region Executive Care has responded to my FCC complaint by finally revealing that Comcast was charging me for their most expensive residential service and that there were cheaper alternatives that I should be using. I have switched my internet service to the cheaper alternative. Therefore over the sixteen (16) months since I first contacted Comcast about my concerns, Comcast extorted nearly $400 from me.
 As I have previously explained, a month after becoming a Comcast customer Comcast raised my monthly bill 41%. I contacted them immediately and they ignored me. They never responded until I contacted Attorney General Madiganâ€™s office, but even then they did not offer a solution. Comcast did not offer a solution until AG Madiganâ€™s office referred my complaint to the FCC. By dragging this out sixteen (16) months they were able to steal nearly $400. Corporate theft by Comcast is similar to the recent AT&T and Wells Fargo thefts. Corporations find it profitable to steal from their customers, because even when they are caught their penalties are only a small fraction of their theft. With their millions of customers, their thefts would net them billions. Even with an AT&T sized fine, which most people would consider large, that amount would only be a small fraction of their theft. Corporate crime does pay. In our country, we need more Enron/Arthur Anderson type solutions to convince companies that their profits should be earned not stolen.
 Comcast is a criminal enterprise. Sincerely,
 Glendale Heights, IL 60139

360143,Comcast Internet Speed/Quality of Service and price,6/23/2015,8:52:54 PM,Internet,Glenview,Illinois,60025,Solved,Yes,"My Comcast internet service has not been satisfactory in the past few months. The latency/ping has increased substantially. While fast, high latency means the internet feels exceptionally slow.
 The price is also not satisfactory. I have no options for competition where I live. Comcast is the only internet service provider. I know I am being charged too much for internet and services when the new customer rate is much lower than what I am paying.
 It is offensive that a new customer gets a lower price than me, an established customer with many years of service with the company. It feels like extortion. Its also extremely difficult to even see the rates new customers get. Comcast obscures those prices at every possible opportunity on their website if I log in. I would like the new customer rate, which is substantially cheaper than what I am paying. In addition to fixing the latency of my internet.

360714,Internet bundled with TV,6/24/2015,1:29:54 AM,Internet,Gold Bar,Washington,98251,Solved,No,"My only available broadband ISP (Comcast) refuses to lower my overall price of service when I remove cable television from my service package. I was ""forced"" into taking a package initially when I signed up for internet service that included a cable subscription despite expressing that I only wanted Internet service. The price for this package was 35 dollars a month. Internet service on its own without cable was 65 dollars a month. Due to the obvious price difference, I took the cable package reluctantly and have just never watched cable television. For the past 3 years my bill has been slowly creeping upwards until it has now reached over 80 dollars a month for the same service level. I tried to reduce my monthly payments by simply removing cable service, but that would actually INCREASE my bill. In what world does reducing services provided increase the overall cost of something? In a normal, non-monopolistic world, a lunch combo of a sandwich ($6 individually) and drink ($5 individually) would be offered for $10 as an incentive to get both and save a bit of money. In Comcast's world, if you were buying lunch you'd pay 10 dollars for a sandwich, and a drink, but 20 dollars for just the sandwich or just the drink in order to force you in a financial sense into choosing the combo even if you weren't thirsty for the drink and wanted to save money by not buying one.
 Why does Comcast do this? My belief is that it is to continue to make money from advertisers. In order to keep advertising dollars high, cable subscriber numbers need to remain high. At this point ""cord cutters"" are so abundant, that if they didn't INCREASE your price for not getting cable and just getting internet, their cable subscriber numbers would take a dive along with their advertising revenue.
 This practice to artificially keep cable subscriber numbers high is harming consumers and preventing them from purchasing what they want and only what they want in order to save money. Please put a stop to this practice by requiring Comcast to offer me a lower monthly rate if I cancel my cable service rather than increasing my rate if I cancel a service I don't want.
 I would go elsewhere with my business, but there is no other broadband company to switch to that provides high speed service as defined by the FCC.

228419,Wrongful billing - repeated since December 2013,4/10/2015,11:34:55 AM,Internet,Grand Rapids,Michigan,49546,Closed,No,"Comcast continues to bill for equipment I own and no longer lease. I purchased my modem in 2013. I returned my leased modem to Comcast in person and I was assured that billing for it would stop. After 3 calls, it finally did stop. Then it restarted for no apparent reason. I've now gone through that cycle at least 4 additional times. Repeated promises that the problem has been corrected go unfulfilled. Agents have hang up on me a number of times as I attempt to resolve the issue. I need a permanent solution to this illegal billing.

 Comcast has told me that because i didn't contact them within their 60day window of this happening, that the $170 that they charged me cannot be re-imbursed.
 The ""investigation"" that they did to see if these charges were valid took longer then 60 days.

223708,Comcast/Xfinity service,4/8/2015,11:48:30 AM,Internet,Grand Rapids,Michigan,49504,Closed,No,"I have had nothing but problems, with zero resolution, but am expected to continuously pay for my service. We moved from one place to another and had problems with a no show tech, and a very rude tech, who refused to do his job, until I said I was going to call customer service. I am paying for a service that only works sometimes, and when working is not fast as advertised.
 Also, I made arrangements on my bill last week for this week Friday, it's Wednesday, and my service was cut. When I called customer service, 3 out of 4 reps blatantly refused to do their job. The 4th rep restored me until Friday, as discussed previously. This is the second month in a row that this has happened. I feel that I should not have to call in and speak with 4 different people, in order to get something resolved, that should have never occurred in the first place!
 During this whole debacle, not once has Comcast offered anything to me, the customer who has dealt with horrible service since the day I signed up for self install (which is not what it seems), and a tech that never showed.
 Someone needs to be held accountable.

They say that they forgave 3 monte before billing me for the 4th. Our average data usage does not exceed 100GB/monthBut they said we used 900+ in Sept., Jan. Feb and March. Three of those monte we were not even in the home where the data was supposedly used. I was not contacted or warned that this was going to happen. When I complained the said they were ""opening an investigation."" A few days later I got a call saying that the investigation concluded that we did use the excess data. I sled for proof and they said they couldn't give me that information. I want this charge removed from my bill as I believe it is erroneous.

I recently had a problem with my internet and called Comcast. They did something to fix it, but I noticed that my bill went to $137 a month after. I did not change services of any kind. They told me to keep the price I had of $122 I had to make a 24 month agreement. This is AFTER I have had this service for 3-4 months. I am not sure if they created an error on their end, but that isn't my concern. I think they are trying to force me into an agreement to keep what I already had. Due to this I am working to cancel my Comcast service for another provider. I believe they are not honoring their agreements and are trying to force things on us the customers.

343555,Comcast,6/16/2015,2:44:41 PM,Internet,Greentown,Indiana,46936,Solved,No,"5/18 I called Comcast to report an ongoing issue with my video and internet. I have one box that we are not able to view tv on at all and the other boxes pixel and freeze and my internet cuts off often. I really REALLY don't like calling Comcast so I let it go for a very long time... but I did finally call and booked a tech and was very pleased that he could come out the next day. I ensured that my 21 year old Son would be home for the tech and I came to work. I work as a customer care representative for Brighthouse... My Son reported that the tech did come... spent 10 minutes outside and stated ""this is all jacked up"" and that he had called his supervisor and was waiting for him to arrive. The tech left and said the supervisor would be in touch. No one ever followed up.
 Meanwhile... life goes on and I go to work every day and my Husband goes to work every day and my service is still not working every day. I work 10 hour days 5 days a week and on my off days I see numerous Dr's due to my health issues. My Husband works 10 hour days 6 days a week and he works nights so needless to say, calling Comcast is not high on our to do list.
 My bill did get behind. I won't sugarcoat it. I paid late for a few months. but I always paid. And I paid over 250.00 a month for my services.... which were delivered to me ""all jacked up"" according to a Comcast representative.
 Today... I made a payment on my account of 350.54 and Comcast promptly took that payment and turned off my service because I still owe 140.00 more.
 I tried to call today to work out arrangements on that. While I am at work myself. I spoke to collections after finding a bypass to the automated system that kept looping me back to ""how do you want to make that payment"" and was told they would be happy to turn my service back on as long as I offered a post dated check... I do not deal with checks. I pay everything electronically. Sure... I pay it through a checking account but it is still electronically... not with a check. She claimed to understand... and sent me to billing to work out an arrangement... Billing told me that only collections can do that and only with a post dated check... But... the billing rep was going to try to help me and he put me on hold. Came back after several moments, thanked me for holding and told me that he was still working on it. Next think I know I hear a ring tone in my ear and a female voice greeting me. I explained I had been holding for a different rep and she promptly hung up the phone... ... .....
 I was out of time and patience.
 I called back during my lunch hour, spoke to collections and billing again and requested a supervisor who equally had no desire to maintain my 250.00 a month business. She even told me that collections was willing to turn my service back on but ""you don't have a checking account so we can't""... really? that's what I'm worth?
 So now I'm mad... 2 hours on the phone. I spent 1/2 hour in chat before that. While I am at work! My entire lunch hour.... no resolution... so I request a credit for the time I had ""jacked up"" service. She states they cannot credit me because that would be on the service repair dept to do and transferred me... and I waited... and waited... and my call was dropped.
 I would like my account credited, I work in tech repair so I am sure that they can verify that my signal levels to my equipment have not been up to par. Iâ€™d like that credit applied and Iâ€™d like my service turned back on with the understanding that I will pay my bill current before the next due date of 07/09/15. Iâ€™d like all this to happen with no more time spent by me on the phone. Then Iâ€™d like my service fixed.

224687,Issues with Comcast Customer Service due to loss of Internet,4/8/2015,4:09:57 PM,Internet,Greenwood Village,Colorado,80111,Closed,No,"I woke up Friday 4/3 to no internet connection. That same evening after I got home from work, I signed on to the Comcast website via my cell phone data/network and went through all the steps to ""trouble shoot"" the issue--restarting the modem and router, 'forgetting' my network and reconnecting, etc. This was all unsuccessful. I then signed into a chat session with a Comcast analyst, Josean. This individual had me go through all these steps again, then restarted my modem remotely, then told me it was probably my router (which is not Comcast equipment, but third party) and had me bypass the router by connecting my computer directly to my modem via Ethernet. Still no internet. After sending me a link to complete some sort of test on my connection, I was somehow disconnected from this chat. After trying to reconnect, I got a new analyst, Helda, who started having me repeat everything I had just done. I tried explaining the situation and they eventually said they could set up an appointment with a technician, but at this point it was late Friday evening, I was already over my cell phone data and thus being charged, and I was frustrated, knowing it was a holiday weekend and not knowing what my schedule would look like starting Monday for availability for an appointment. I signed off. All weekend I tried restarting everything, powering off, reconnecting, and still no internet. On Monday morning at work, I signed on to the Comcast Support chat again and the analyst, Ankur, had me once again complete all of the steps I had already tried even though I asked if they could just please make an appointment for a technician to come out. They were convinced this was my issue because my account showed that all devices were working properly and I had full connection. I played along and re-completed all steps to fix my internet. Nothing worked--even once again, bypassing my router and trying to connect wired via Ethernet to the modem. Finally, after asking all along to make an appointment for a technician, the analyst, Ankur, scheduled a 2 hour appointment window for Tuesday morning 4/7. I verified the time and date several times. Tuesday morning, I made arrangements to be available for this 2 hour window. No one came. I called Comcast and they told me no appointment was ever made for my account. I was very frustrated, because of this and because it was day 5 with no internet. The agent I spoke with, Alex, apologized and told me she would schedule a new appointment for Wednesday 4/8 (today). I verified the time and date several times and she assured me it was scheduled. I then asked for a bill adjustment. She put me on hold for 15 minutes (while I was at work) and then told me her supervisor had approved this and I would see an adjustment on my next bill. Again, I made arrangements to be available for my new appointment this morning. Half way through my appointment window, I had not heard from anyone. I called Comcast to verify the appointment after what had already happened the day before, and once again, they told me no appointment had been scheduled. At this point, six days without internet, several hours trying to resolve the issue myself with Comcast support, and then several hours spent waiting for appointments that were never entered into the system, I was very, very frustrated. The new agent on the phone, Ronald, apologized and told me he would make a new appointment. This time, he gave me a work order # for verification and I triple checked all my info plus the time and date. Supposedly, my new appointment (the third one) is for tomorrow, Thursday 4/9, day 7 with no
 internet. I asked again, for a bill adjustment and he told me that he would ""make note of this request"" on my account. That was it. I am so angry about the inconvenience, the frustration and stress, the time out of my work day spent trying to fix this, that I sent complaint to the office of Tom Karinshak (Senior Vice President of Customer Experience at Comcast) on the Comcast website detailing everything. I received a response from Alana T. in that office that I found incredibly dismissive, that basically told me that I should have contacted Comcast sooner, and did not make enough of an effort to schedule an appointment sooner. I wrote back detailing all the efforts I had made AGAIN. Everything else aside, I cannot believe that I was told 2 appointments were made, and then they somehow did not make it to my account. Every single person that I have spoken with (5 agents in total) has told me all the same things, and I have tried them all. All 5 agents have tried to blame the issue on my router, despite the fact that it is brand new and even bypassing it gives me no internet. I have had some bad experiences with Comcast before, setting up my account in November, but I was willing to overlook them. This, however, is inexcusable in my opinion. After everything I have gone through, being charged extra on my cell phone to extra data usage because I have no internet, interrupting my work schedule for 6 hours (including tomorrow) just for appointments, several hours spent speaking with agents and trying to trouble shoot, I expect Comcast to fix it in a timely manner and credit my account accordingly. But instead, so far I have gotten a dismissive email from an Alana T. at Tom Karinshak's office, telling me I need to try harder next time, and scripted apologies from agents. At this point, I don't have much faith that a technician will come tomorrow, but even if they do, it will be 7 days without internet, and all of the hassle detailed above.

360665,Speeds being throttled.,6/24/2015,12:47:19 AM,Internet,Gresham,Oregon,97030,Open,No,"Every evening between 8:30PM until 1:00AM my internet speeds get throttled by my isp. Nearly every other time of day, my speeds are at, or more aptly - slightly below what I am paying for. It is during these evening hours that my speeds drop dramatically and my wife and I are barely able to even check email quickly. As some one who works from home, and has international clients, I expect that at all hours of the day, my speeds remain the same so that I may do business with all my clients, when they need to have their business attended to.

 We urge you to contact that agency about this matter.

226766,Comcast,4/9/2015,2:36:14 PM,Internet,Grosse Ile,Michigan,48138,Closed,No,"I have been trying since February to get a billing issue corrected. Comcast was charging me for 7 cable boxes and I had 6. I have put in ticket after ticket with them and there is no resolve. They keep telling me they must search for the equipment. I wait 2 weeks to call back and then they just open another ticket and it goes no where. I changed the service I get with them and when the installers came, they gave me the number of the box that was stuck on my account that did not exist. The installers said they could not help me. I don't know where to go from here as they are keeping my money, passing the problem and I am getting no where.
 Also, I changed the service as I was told I would save $50.00 a month and I am only saving $30.00 - not the $50.00 I was promised. One department passes off to another and another. I don't know where else to go.

 Follow-up message by Consumer on 5/4/2015 6:11:21 PM:
 I am not sure how this ticket can be closed. We are still dealing with the issues at hand. Some issues have been resolved, but it is untrue to say that the issues have been resolved. I do not agree with this. Comcast came to my home today to try to correct some things. Equipment that I do not have is still on my account. They have not completed their investigation.
 Please keep this open. It should never have been closed. I even wrote the person I am dealing with at Comcast and she assured me that she would not be closing anything as the problems have not been resolved. (b) (6)"
364523,Comcast,6/25/2015,12:16:43 PM,Internet,Grosse Pointe,Michigan,48230,Solved,No,"My only available cable and high speed internet option is Comcast. My bill consistently and mysteriously creeps up with new fees. I call and it is lowered slightly, but then climbs again. I am unable to unbundle all the services in a meaningful manner. Internet and phone cost more than a cable package (initially), but then the package price starts to climb.
 I have no options but to pay their outrageous rates and then call when they slowly raise them. It's a game: How much can the sneak in before a customer complains. They currently have a monopoly, which is more like a stranglehold on my internet connection and fees.
 I would like other options, but none exist, as Comcast appears to have rigged the system to be the only option.

360578,Comcast Bundles,6/23/2015,11:58:01 PM,Internet,Grosse Pointe Farms,Michigan,48236,Solved,No,"The description of my problem is aptly captured here: http://arstechnica.com/business/2015/06/want%C2%AD-a-lower-comcast-bill-complain-to-the-fcc/ -- in a nutshell, I have the same issue as the gentlemen there. I cannot lower my Comcast bill. All I want is their Internet service, and yet they force me to buy a bundle that includes cable television b/c the bundle is actually cheaper at the time of purchase than just paying for Internet service. What's worse is that after 6 months, they'll claim the ""bundle promotion expired"" and raise your bill back up. This just happened to me. My bill went from around $40/mo back up to ~$60/mo. When I called to complain about it, they told me the bundle promotion was expired, and there were no new promotions. They also told me that dropping the bundle and just going with Internet service would be more expensive. This is absurd. They are the only legitimate option for Internet in my area. I have had it with them. I hope the FCC can look at this with a critical eye and see it for what it is and adjust their behavior.

274464,Comcast Fraud?,5/5/2015,4:33:13 PM,Internet,Grosse Pointe Park,Michigan,48230,Closed,No,"I signed up for $24.99 Internet, provided my own modem, and was prepared to do my own

 Technician comes to activate Internet service at outside switch, leaves a card, never rang the buzzer.
 I make a new appointment, then get slapped with undisclosed $59.95 in fees.

230174,Comcast surprise increase in charges,4/10/2015,11:05:54 PM,Internet,Grovetown,Georgia,30813,Closed,No,"Apparently Comcast has introduced a download limit in my area (Augusta, GA) for market testing purposes. They did this with no announcement that I am aware of.
 Today I got an email that says I have been over my limit for the last three months and am now over my limit for the month of April. Apparently there is a three month grace period which was January-March. This is the first time I have been informed of any of this. I assume that Comcast will now try to bill me more than the agreed upon monthly fee.

231207,Internet Problems,4/12/2015,1:13:28 PM,Internet,Gurnee,Illinois,60031,Closed,No,"I have been having months of issues with my Comcast internet speed in which I cannot do things I need to do for work or personally. On Wednesday, March 25th, I spent 3 hours on the phone with Comcast trying various things. After about 2.5 hours, the customer service rep sent me to an internet expert. Once on the phone with him, I had to review my issue with him again. He read the notes and said the CS rep did everything right and I don't have a speed issue because I hit 68 mbps and it is a range issue. I told him it isn't right that I have to sit right in front of the modem to hit 68 and cannot go in the room connected to the modem room. I told him I need a fix and that I have spent 3 hours on the phone. He proceeded to tell me that he was just on the phone with someone for 6 hours who wouldn't listen and had probably be drinking. I took this as him implying that I was the same way. He told me I would have to take all my equipment in to exchange it, but it wouldn't help. After having speeds of 29 - 46 mbps I contacted my Comcast sales rep (Ron Wozny) who provided me a direct dial internet number the sales team uses which didn't work. I called him back immediately and he stated that they must have changed the number and that he would contact his supervisor and get back to me within the hour. As of today, one day later, I have not heard from him. After experiencing speeds no higher than 23 mbps today, I sent him a text to see if he had a new number and he has not responded. These are the major instances, but I have had nothing but poor service each time I have called the customer service line or my sales rep without resolution. I need this fixed or I want to cancel my service.

 I am retired as an equity compensation consultant. Our bill pay company accidentally made a huge mistake when paying our March 2015 bill to Comcast on 3/12/2015. Our monthly Comcast Internet service has been $85.84 for several years. Our bill pay company sent Comcast a check for $8,584.00. It caused our checking account to overdraw. On 4/2/2015, the Billing & Payments Comcast online page shows that we have a ""credit on your account of +$8501.07. Twelve different Comcast employees in Denver 800-391-3000 told us that it is the Comcast policy to wait 4 to 6 weeks to refund our money. This policy is extremely wrong. That money is our retirement savings that Comcast is holding at no interest. Can you get them to Fed Ex a check to us immediately? We have called them 12+ times since March 12, 2015. The employees do nothing. We are appealing to you. Will you help us?

 I have suffered over charge after overcharge from Comcast between January and March of 2015. While it appears - at least for the moment - that Comcast has stopped billing me for a modem that I returned in December, the issue is STILL not resolved. There is still $10 outstanding owed from Comcast to me.
 I certainly understand that this is a very small amount of money, h
