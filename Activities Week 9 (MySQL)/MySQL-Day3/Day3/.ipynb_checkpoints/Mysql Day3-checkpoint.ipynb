    "  * States/countries in addresses: Think back to the `sakila` database, where street addresses, cities, and countries were stored in different tables. So if we were to change the address of a customer who moved to a different country, for example, all the information across the tables would need to change. This is called maintaining the _referential integrity_.\n",
